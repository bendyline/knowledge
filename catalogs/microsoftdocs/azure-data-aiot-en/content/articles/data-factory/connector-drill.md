# Copy data from Drill using Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics

**APPLIES TO:** Azure Data Factory Azure Synapse Analytics



> **Tip:**
> [Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory) is the next generation of Azure Data Factory, with a simpler architecture, built-in AI, and new features. If you're new to data integration, start with Fabric Data Factory. Existing ADF workloads can upgrade to Fabric to access new capabilities across data science, real-time analytics, and reporting.

> - [Upgrade from Azure Data Factory to Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/migrate-planning-azure-data-factory).


> **Important:**
> This connector is at [End of Support stage](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/data-factory/connector-deprecation-plan.md). You are recommended to migrate to [ODBC connector](connector-odbc.md) by installing a driver.

This article outlines how to use the Copy Activity in an Azure Data Factory or Synapse Analytics pipeline to copy data from Drill. It builds on the [copy activity overview](copy-activity-overview.md) article that presents a general overview of copy activity.

## Supported capabilities

This Drill connector is supported for the following capabilities:

| Supported capabilities | IR |
| --- | --- |
| [Copy activity](copy-activity-overview.md) (source/-) | &#9312; &#9313; |
| [Lookup activity](control-flow-lookup-activity.md) | &#9312; &#9313; |

*&#9312; Azure integration runtime &#9313; Self-hosted integration runtime*

For a list of data stores that are supported as sources or sinks by the copy activity, see the [Supported data stores](copy-activity-overview.md#supported-data-stores-and-formats) table.

The service provides a built-in driver to enable connectivity, therefore you don't need to manually install any driver using this connector.

## Prerequisites

<!--
    Separate the generic requirement on Self-hosted Integration Runtime setup from connector articles.
-->
If your data store is located inside an on-premises network, an Azure virtual network, or Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, you need to configure a [self-hosted integration runtime](create-self-hosted-integration-runtime.md) to connect to it.

If your data store is a managed cloud data service, you can use the Azure Integration Runtime. If the access is restricted to IPs that are approved in the firewall rules, you can add [Azure Integration Runtime IPs](azure-integration-runtime-ip-addresses.md) to the allow list. 

You can also use the [managed virtual network integration runtime](tutorial-managed-virtual-network-on-premise-sql-server.md) feature in Azure Data Factory to access the on-premises network without installing and configuring a self-hosted integration runtime.

For more information about the network security mechanisms and options supported by Data Factory, see [Data access strategies](data-access-strategies.md).


## Getting started

<!--
    Separate the generic "Get started" paragraph from each connector-* article in azure-docs-pr/ to ease future central update.
-->

To perform the copy activity with a pipeline, you can use one of the following tools or SDKs:

- [Copy Data tool](quickstart-hello-world-copy-data-tool.md)
- [Azure portal](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/data-factory/quickstart-create-data-factory-portal.md)
- [.NET SDK](quickstart-create-data-factory-dot-net.md)
- [Python SDK](quickstart-create-data-factory-python.md)
- [Azure PowerShell](quickstart-create-data-factory-powershell.md)
- [REST API](quickstart-create-data-factory-rest-api.md)
- [Azure Resource Manager template](quickstart-create-data-factory-resource-manager-template.md)


## Create a linked service to Drill using UI

Use the following steps to create a linked service to Drill in the Azure portal UI.

1. Browse to the Manage tab in your Azure Data Factory or Synapse workspace and select Linked Services, then click New:

    # [Azure Data Factory](#tab/data-factory)

    Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Data Factory UI.

    # [Azure Synapse](#tab/synapse-analytics)

    Screenshot of creating a new linked service with Azure Synapse UI.

2. Search for Drill and select the Drill connector.

## Connector configuration details

The following sections provide details about properties that are used to define Data Factory entities specific to Drill connector.

## Linked service properties

The following properties are supported for Drill linked service:

| Property | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| type | The type property must be set to: **Drill** | Yes |
| connectionString | An ODBC connection string to connect to Drill. <br/>You can also put password in Azure Key Vault and pull the `pwd` configuration out of the connection string. Refer to the following samples and [Store credentials in Azure Key Vault](store-credentials-in-key-vault.md) article with more details. | Yes |
| connectVia | The [Integration Runtime](concepts-integration-runtime.md) to be used to connect to the data store. Learn more from [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. If not specified, it uses the default Azure Integration Runtime. | No |

**Example:**

```json
{
    "name": "DrillLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Drill",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "ConnectionType=Direct;Host=<host>;Port=<port>;AuthenticationType=Plain;UID=<user name>;PWD=<password>"
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```

**Example: store password in Azure Key Vault**

```json
{
    "name": "DrillLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "type": "Drill",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "ConnectionType=Direct;Host=<host>;Port=<port>;AuthenticationType=Plain;UID=<user name>;",
            "pwd": { 
                "type": "AzureKeyVaultSecret", 
                "store": { 
                    "referenceName": "<Azure Key Vault linked service name>", 
                    "type": "LinkedServiceReference" 
                }, 
                "secretName": "<secretName>" 
            }
        },
        "connectVia": {
            "referenceName": "<name of Integration Runtime>",
            "type": "IntegrationRuntimeReference"
        }
    }
}
```


## Dataset properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining datasets, see the [datasets](concepts-datasets-linked-services.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Drill dataset.

To copy data from Drill, set the type property of the dataset to **DrillTable**. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| type | The type property of the dataset must be set to: **DrillTable** | Yes |
| schema | Name of the schema. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |
| table | Name of the table. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |
| tableName | Name of the table with schema. This property is supported for backward compatibility. Use `schema` and `table` for new workload. | No (if "query" in activity source is specified) |

**Example**

```json
{
    "name": "DrillDataset",
    "properties": {
        "type": "DrillTable",
        "typeProperties": {},
        "schema": [],
        "linkedServiceName": {
            "referenceName": "<Drill linked service name>",
            "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
        }
    }
}
```

## Copy activity properties

For a full list of sections and properties available for defining activities, see the [Pipelines](concepts-pipelines-activities.md) article. This section provides a list of properties supported by Drill source.

### DrillSource as source

To copy data from Drill, set the source type in the copy activity to **DrillSource**. The following properties are supported in the copy activity **source** section:

| Property | Description | Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| type | The type property of the copy activity source must be set to: **DrillSource** | Yes |
| query | Use the custom SQL query to read data. For example: `"SELECT * FROM MyTable"`. | No (if "tableName" in dataset is specified) |

```json
"activities":[
    {
        "name": "CopyFromDrill",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [
