This article describes how ASP.NET Core apps start up and how to configure services and the app's request pipeline.

For Blazor startup guidance, which adds to or supersedes the guidance in this article, see [blazor/fundamentals/startup](../blazor/fundamentals/startup.md).

**Applies to: \>= aspnetcore-6.0**

## The `Program` file

ASP.NET Core apps initialize and configure startup in the app's `Program` file (`Program.cs`).

The first part of the `Program` file focuses on building the app. This phase utilizes [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.CreateBuilder%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.CreateBuilder%252A) to initialize a new instance of the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder) class with preconfigured defaults before the app is started. The ASP.NET Core project templates assign the web application builder to a variable named `builder`: 

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```

Properties of the web application builder include:

* [`builder.Configuration`](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Configuration) is a [Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfigurationBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfigurationBuilder) and [Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfigurationRoot](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfigurationRoot) for managing configuration sources and providers. For more information, see [fundamentals/configuration/index](configuration/index.md).
* [`builder.Environment`](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Environment) is an [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostEnvironment](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostEnvironment) that provides information about the app's web hosting environment. For more information, see [fundamentals/environments](environments.md).
* [`builder.Host`](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Host) is an [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostBuilder) for configuring host-specific properties. For more information, see [fundamentals/host/generic-host](host/generic-host.md).
* [`builder.Logging`](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Logging) is an [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggingBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILoggingBuilder) with extension methods that add and manage logging providers. For more information, see [fundamentals/logging/index](logging/index.md).
* [`builder.Metrics`](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Metrics) (.NET 8 or later) allows enabling metrics and directing their output. For more information, see [metrics/overview](../metrics/overview.md).
* [`builder.Services`](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Services) is a collection of dependency injection (DI) services ([Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceCollection](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceCollection)) for the app to compose for [Inversion of Control (IoC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/modern-web-apps-azure-architecture/architectural-principles#dependency-inversion). For more information, see [fundamentals/dependency-injection](dependency-injection.md).
* [`builder.WebHost`](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.WebHost) is an [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostBuilder) for configuring server specific properties.

The app is built by calling [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Build%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Build%252A), which returns the built [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication). The ASP.NET Core project templates assign the built web application to a variable named `app`:

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();
```

The next part of the `Program` file focuses on establishing the HTTP request handling pipeline as a series of [middleware components](middleware/index.md). Each middleware performs operations on an [`HttpContext`](http-context.md) and either invokes the next middleware in the pipeline or terminates the request. By convention, middleware components are added to the pipeline by invoking an extension method that starts with "`Use`." For more information, see [fundamentals/middleware/index](middleware/index.md).

The [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Run%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Run%252A) method starts the app and blocks the calling thread until the host is shut down:

```csharp
app.Run();
```

When [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Run%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Run%252A) executes, the app transitions to an active, running process:

1. Hosted services start.

   The host loops through all registered [hosted services](host/hosted-services.md) ([Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostedService](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostedService) instances) and calls their [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostedService.StartAsync%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostedService.StartAsync%252A) methods. Unless the app opts into concurrent hosted service startup (.NET 8 or later), hosted services start sequentially in the order of their DI container registrations. For more information, see [fundamentals/host/hosted-services](host/hosted-services.md).

1. The middleware pipeline is built.

   When [`builder.Build`](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplicationBuilder.Build%252A) is called, dependencies are resolved, but the actual processing pipeline isn't completely set. When [`app.Run`](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Run%252A) executes, the framework finalizes the HTTP middleware pipeline. The declared middleware methods and endpoint mappings are compiled into a single, high-performance execution delegate sequence. For more information, see [fundamentals/middleware/index](middleware/index.md).

1. The web server ([Kestrel](servers/kestrel.md) by default) is started.

   The host looks inside its dependency container, locates the registered server implementation (usually Kestrel), and triggers its startup cycle. Kestrel then: 
   
   * Looks up the defined hosting URLs and ports from configuration, environment variables, or command-line arguments.
   * Opens and allocates physical network sockets.
   * Binds ports and begins listening for incoming traffic.

   For more information, see [fundamentals/host/generic-host](host/generic-host.md), [fundamentals/servers/index](servers/index.md), and [fundamentals/servers/kestrel](servers/kestrel.md).

1. Application started lifetime events are triggered.

   The [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime) service fires its [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime.ApplicationStarted](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime.ApplicationStarted) token, which invokes callbacks registered on the token. Any callbacks, database seeders, or other custom event listeners that are wired up to wait for the token to fire are triggered to start processing.

1. The main execution thread is blocked while the app runs.

   [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Run%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Run%252A) (`app.Run()`) synchronously waits until shutdown.

1. The app is ready to process requests.

   At this point, the command shell logs hosting diagnostics:

   ```text
   info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
         Now listening on: https://localhost:7123
   info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]
         Now listening on: http://localhost:5123
   info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
         Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.
   ```

  The app remains in this state indefinitely, passing incoming web traffic down the middleware pipeline and sending responses.

When shutdown is signaled, for example when <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> is detected in the command shell running the app or a container orchestration tool sends a SIGTERM event, [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Run%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.WebApplication.Run%252A) unblocks and the following actions take place:

1. [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime.ApplicationStopping](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime.ApplicationStopping) tokens are triggered, which allows the app to run logic before the shutdown process begins.

1. The Kestrel server is shut down, which disables new connections. The server waits for requests on existing connections to complete for as long as the shutdown timeout allows. The server sends the connection close header for further requests on existing connections.

1. The host shuts down registered hosted services. Unless the app opts into stopping hosted services concurrently (.NET 8 or later), hosted services stop sequentially in the reverse order of their DI container registrations. For more information, see [fundamentals/host/hosted-services](host/hosted-services.md).

1. [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime.ApplicationStopped%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostApplicationLifetime.ApplicationStopped%252A) event handlers are triggered, which allows the app to run logic after the app has shut down.

1. Console execution gracefully exits with an exit code of 0.



**Applies to: < aspnetcore-6.0**

The `Startup` class configures services and the app's request pipeline.

## The `Startup` class

ASP.NET Core apps use a startup class, which is named `Startup` by convention. The `Startup` class:

* Optionally includes a [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.ConfigureServices%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.ConfigureServices%252A) method to configure the app's *services*. A service is a reusable component that provides app functionality. Services are *registered* in `ConfigureServices` and consumed across the app via [dependency injection (DI)](dependency-injection.md) or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.ApplicationServices%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.ApplicationServices%252A).
* Includes a [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.Configure%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.Configure%252A) method to create the app's request processing pipeline.

`ConfigureServices` and `Configure` are called by the ASP.NET Core runtime when the app starts:

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        ...
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

The `Startup` class is specified when the app's [host](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Findex%23host) is built. The `Startup` class is typically specified by calling [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WebHostBuilderExtensions.UseStartup%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.WebHostBuilderExtensions.UseStartup%252A) on the host builder:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            });
}
```

The host provides services that are available to the `Startup` class constructor. The app adds additional services via `ConfigureServices`. Both the host and app services are available in `Configure` and throughout the app.

Only the following service types can be injected into the `Startup` constructor when using the [Generic Host](host/generic-host.md) ([Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostBuilder)):

* [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostEnvironment](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostEnvironment)
* [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostEnvironment](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.IHostEnvironment)
* [Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfiguration](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.IConfiguration)

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    private readonly IWebHostEnvironment _env;

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
        _env = env;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        if (_env.IsDevelopment())
        {
        }
        else
        {
        }
    }
}
```

Most services aren't available until the `Configure` method is called.

> **Note:**
> The private field in the preceding example for [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostEnvironment](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostEnvironment) is named with an underscore (`_env`). It's also acceptable to adopt a coding convention that uses the same name as the injected [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostEnvironment](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IWebHostEnvironment) (`env`) when the private field uses the [`this` keyword](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/this) (`this.env = env` in the constructor and `env.IsDevelopment()` in the `ConfigureServices` method).
>
> The ASP.NET Core project templates prior to .NET 8 and C# 12 don't adopt *primary constructors*, but the preceding code can be refactored to adopt a primary constructor if your organization uses a .NET 8 or later SDK and the app targets C# 12 or later (for example, `<LangVersion>12.0</LangVersion>`). For more information, see [Declare primary constructors for classes and structs (C# documentation tutorial)](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/primary-constructors) and [Primary constructors (C# Guide)](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/instance-constructors#primary-constructors).

## Multiple `Startup` classes

When the app defines separate `Startup` classes for different environments (for example, `StartupDevelopment`), the appropriate `Startup` class is selected at runtime. The class whose name suffix matches the current environment is prioritized. If the app is run in the `Development` environment and includes both a `Startup` class and a `StartupDevelopment` class, the `StartupDevelopment` class is used. For more information, see [Use multiple environments](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fenvironments%23environment-based-startup-class-and-methods).

## The `ConfigureServices` method

The optional [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.ConfigureServices%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.ConfigureServices%252A) method is:

* Called by the host before the `Configure` method to configure the app's services.
* Where [configuration options](configuration/index.md) are set by convention.

The host may configure some services before `Startup` methods are called. For more information, see [fundamentals/index#host](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Findex%23host).

For features that require substantial setup, there are `Add{Service}` extension methods on [Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceCollection](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.IServiceCollection), such as:

* **Add**DbContext
* **Add**DefaultIdentity
* **Add**EntityFrameworkStores
* **Add**RazorPages

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {

        services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
            options.UseSqlServer(
                Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
        services.AddDefaultIdentity<IdentityUser>(
            options => options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
            .AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();

        services.AddRazorPages();
    }
}
```

Adding services to the service container makes them available within the app and in the `Configure` method. The services are resolved via [dependency injection](dependency-injection.md) or from [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.ApplicationServices%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder.ApplicationServices%252A).

## The `Configure` method

The [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.Configure%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.Configure%252A) method is used to specify how the app responds to HTTP requests. The request pipeline is configured by adding [middleware](middleware/index.md) components to an [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder) instance. `IApplicationBuilder` is available to the `Configure` method, but it isn't registered in the service container. Hosting creates an `IApplicationBuilder` and passes it directly to `Configure`.

The [ASP.NET Core templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) configure the pipeline with support for:

* [Developer Exception Page](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Ferror-handling%23developer-exception-page)
* [Exception handler](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Ferror-handling%23exception-handler-page)
* [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=security%2Fenforcing-ssl%23http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol)
* [HTTPS redirection](../security/enforcing-ssl.md)
* [Static files](static-files.md)
* ASP.NET Core [MVC](../mvc/overview.md) and [Razor Pages](../razor-pages/index.md)

The following example demonstrates middleware for a typical Razor Pages app:

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddRazorPages();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
            app.UseHsts();
        }

        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        app.UseStaticFiles();
        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapRazorPages();
        });
    }
}
```

The preceding sample is for [Razor Pages](../razor-pages/index.md); the MVC version is similar.

Each `Use` extension method adds one or more middleware components to the request pipeline. For instance, [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StaticFileExtensions.UseStaticFiles%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.StaticFileExtensions.UseStaticFiles%252A) configures [middleware](middleware/index.md) to serve [static files](static-files.md).

Each middleware component in the request pipeline is responsible for invoking the next component in the pipeline or short-circuiting the chain, if appropriate.

Additional services, such as `IWebHostEnvironment`, `ILoggerFactory`, or anything defined in `ConfigureServices`, can be specified in the `Configure` method signature. These services are injected if they're available.

For more information on how to use `IApplicationBuilder` and the order of middleware processing, see [fundamentals/middleware/index](middleware/index.md).

## Configure services without a `Startup` class

To configure services and the request processing pipeline without using a `Startup` class, call `ConfigureServices` and `Configure` convenience methods on the host builder. Multiple calls to `ConfigureServices` append to one another. If multiple `Configure` method calls exist, the last `Configure` call is used.

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
            {
            })
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.ConfigureServices(services =>
                {
                    ...
                })
                .Configure(app =>
                {
                    ...
                });
        });
}
```



## Startup filters

While an app typically creates an explicit middleware execution pipeline, a startup filter ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartupFilter](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartupFilter)) is useful for:

* Creating a shared library/NuGet package that automatically loads custom middleware without requiring the app to explicitly call the middleware's "`Use`" method. For example, the library's consumer isn't required to make an `app.UseImageProcessingMiddleware` call for an image-processing middleware in the app's request processing pipeline.
* Guaranteeing a piece of middleware executes before or after other middleware, regardless of how a developer modifies the app's request processing pipeline.

A startup filter implementation provides an [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartupFilter.Configure%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartupFilter.Configure%252A) method that receives and returns an `Action<IApplicationBuilder>`. The [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.IApplicationBuilder) interface is used to configure the app's request pipeline. For more information, see [Create a middleware pipeline with `IApplicationBuilder`](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fmiddleware%2Findex%23create-a-middleware-pipeline-with-iapplicationbuilder).

Each startup filter implementation can add one or more middlewares to the request pipeline. The filters are invoked in the order they're added to the service container. Filters can add middleware before or after passing control to the next filter, thus they append to the beginning or end of the pipeline.

The following example demonstrates how to register a middleware with [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartupFilter](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartupFilter). The `CustomResponseHeaderFilter` startup filter uses middleware to append a custom header (`X-Custom-Header`) to all of the app's responses before other middlewares execute.

`CustomResponseHeaderFilter.cs`:

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

public class CustomResponseHeaderFilter : IStartupFilter
{
    public Action<IApplicationBuilder> Configure(Action<IApplicationBuilder> next)
    {
        return builder =>
        {
            // 1. Add middleware that runs BEFORE subsequent middlewares
            builder.Use(async (context, nextMiddleware) =>
            {
                context.Response.Headers.Append("X-Custom-Header", "VALUE");
                await nextMiddleware();
            });

            // 2. Call the rest of the application's configuration pipeline
            next(builder);

            // 3. (Optional) Add middleware that runs AFTER the rest of the pipeline
        };
    }
}
```

**Applies to: \>= aspnetcore-6.0**

The startup filter implementation is registered in the `Program` file:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddTransient<IStartupFilter, CustomResponseHeaderFilter>();
```



**Applies to: < aspnetcore-6.0**

The startup filter implementation is registered in `Startup.ConfigureServices`:

```csharp
services.AddTransient<IStartupFilter, CustomResponseHeaderFilter>();
```



Middleware execution order is set by the order of startup filter registrations:

* Multiple implementations might interact with the same objects. If ordering is important, order their service registrations to match the order that their middlewares should run.
* Libraries can add middleware with one or more implementations that run before or after other app middleware registered with [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartupFilter](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IStartupFilter). To invoke a startup filter middleware before a middleware added by a library's startup filter:
  * Position the startup filter service registration before the library is added to the service container.
  * To invoke afterward, position the service registration after the library is added.

> **Note:**
> You can't extend the ASP.NET Core app with startup filters when you override the `Configure` delegate. For more information, see [WebApplicationFactory Client returns NotFound for all requests with Overriding Configure method (`dotnet/aspnetcore` #45372)](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/45372).

## Add configuration at startup from an external assembly

An [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IHostingStartup](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.IHostingStartup) implementation allows adding enhancements to an app at startup from an external assembly outside of the app's `Program` file or `Startup` class. For more information, see [fundamentals/configuration/platform-specific-configuration](host/platform-specific-configuration.md).

**Applies to: \>= aspnetcore-6.0**

## The `Startup` class (`ConfigureServices` and `Configure` methods)

*Although supported in ASP.NET Core apps that target .NET 6 or later, using a `Startup` class isn't recommended. For more information, see [migration/50-to-60#new-hosting-model](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=migration%2F50-to-60%23new-hosting-model).*

For information on using the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.ConfigureServices%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.ConfigureServices%252A) and [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.Configure%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.StartupBase.Configure%252A) methods with the minimal hosting model, see the following:

**Applies to: \>= aspnetcore-7.0**

## Measure startup performance

The ASP.NET Core hosting [System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource) emits the `ServerReady` event, which represents the point where the server is ready to respond to requests and can be used to measure startup time. For more information, see [fundamentals/logging/index#eventsource](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Flogging%2Findex%23eventsource).
