# Diagnostic code analysis in ASP.NET Core apps

.NET compiler platform analyzers inspect application code for code quality and style issues.

This article provides links to specific diagnostic messages for ASP.NET Core. For more information on .NET diagnostics, see [Overview of .NET source code analysis](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/overview).

## Diagnostic codes

The following table lists the diagnostics available for ASP.NET Core applications.

> **Note:**
> Not all diagnostics are available in older versions of ASP.NET Core.
