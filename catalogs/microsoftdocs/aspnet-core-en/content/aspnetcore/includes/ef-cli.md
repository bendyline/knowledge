If `dotnet ef` has not been installed, install it as a global tool:

```dotnetcli
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

For more information on the CLI for EF Core, see [EF Core tools reference for the .NET CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet).

> **Note:**
> By default, the architecture of the .NET binaries to install represents the currently running operating system architecture.
> To specify a different architecture, review how to use the `dotnet tool install` command with the ['--arch' option](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-tool-install#options).
