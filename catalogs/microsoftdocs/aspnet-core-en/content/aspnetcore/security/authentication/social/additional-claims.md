# Persist additional claims and tokens from external providers in ASP.NET Core

**Applies to: \>= aspnetcore-6.0**

An ASP.NET Core app can establish additional claims and tokens from external authentication providers, such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter. Each provider reveals different information about users on its platform, but the pattern for receiving and transforming user data into additional claims is the same.

## Prerequisites

Decide which external authentication providers to support in the app. For each provider, register the app and obtain a client ID and client secret. For more information, see [security/authentication/social/index](index.md). The sample app uses the [Google authentication provider](google-logins.md).

## Set the client ID and client secret

The OAuth authentication provider establishes a trust relationship with an app using a client ID and client secret. Client ID and client secret values are created for the app by the external authentication provider when the app is registered with the provider. Each external provider that the app uses must be configured independently with the provider's client ID and client secret. For more information, see the external authentication provider topics that apply:

* [Facebook authentication](facebook-logins.md)
* [Google authentication](google-logins.md)
* [Microsoft authentication](microsoft-logins.md)
* [Twitter authentication](twitter-logins.md)
* [Other authentication providers](other-logins.md)
* [OpenIdConnect](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2)

Optional claims sent in the ID or access token from the authentication provider are usually configured in the provider's online portal. For example, Microsoft Entra ID permits assigning optional claims to the app's ID token in the app registration's **Token configuration** blade. For more information, see [How to: Provide optional claims to your app (Azure documentation)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-optional-claims). For other providers, consult their external documentation sets.

The sample app configures the Google authentication provider with a client ID and client secret provided by Google:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Program.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle\&highlight=11-12)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Program.cs.md)

## Establish the authentication scope

Specify the list of permissions to retrieve from the provider by specifying the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthOptions.Scope*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthOptions.Scope*). Authentication scopes for common external providers appear in the following table.

| Provider | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Facebook | `https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth` |
| Google | `profile`, `email`, `openid` |
| Microsoft | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize` |
| Twitter | `https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate` |

In the sample app, Google's `profile`, `email`, and `openid` scopes are automatically added by the framework when `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.GoogleOpenIdConnectExtensions.AddGoogleOpenIdConnect` is called on the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilder). If the app requires additional scopes, add them to the options. In the following example, the Google `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/user.birthday.read` scope is added to retrieve a user's birthday:

```csharp
options.Scope.Add("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/user.birthday.read");
```

## Map user data keys and create claims

In the provider's options, specify a [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonKey*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonKey*) or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonSubKey*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonSubKey*) for each key or subkey in the external provider's JSON user data for the app identity to read on sign in. For more information on claim types, see [System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes).

The sample app creates locale (`urn:google:locale`) and picture (`urn:google:picture`) claims from the `locale` and `picture` keys in Google user data:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Program.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle2\&highlight=6-7)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Program.cs.md)

In `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UI.Pages.Account.Internal.ExternalLoginModel.OnPostConfirmationAsync`, an [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityUser](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityUser) (`ApplicationUser`) is signed into the app with [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%601.SignInAsync*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%25601.SignInAsync*). During the sign in process, the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UserManager%601](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UserManager%25601) can store an `ApplicationUser` claims for user data available from the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.ExternalLoginInfo.Principal*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.ExternalLoginInfo.Principal*).

In the sample app, `OnPostConfirmationAsync` (`Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs`) establishes the locale (`urn:google:locale`) and picture (`urn:google:picture`) claims for the signed in `ApplicationUser`, including a claim for [System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes.GivenName](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes.GivenName):

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_OnPostConfirmationAsync\&highlight=27-47)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs.md)

By default, a user's claims are stored in the authentication cookie. If the authentication cookie is too large, it can cause the app to fail because:

* The browser detects that the cookie header is too long.
* The overall size of the request is too large.

If a large amount of user data is required for processing user requests:

* Limit the number and size of user claims for request processing to only what the app requires.
* Use a custom [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.ITicketStore](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.ITicketStore) for the cookie authentication middleware's [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.SessionStore](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.SessionStore) to store identity across requests. Preserve large quantities of identity information on the server while only sending a small session identifier key to the client.

## Save the access token

[Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.RemoteAuthenticationOptions.SaveTokens*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.RemoteAuthenticationOptions.SaveTokens*) defines whether access and refresh tokens should be stored in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Authentication.AuthenticationProperties](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Authentication.AuthenticationProperties) after a successful authorization. `SaveTokens` is set to `false` by default to reduce the size of the final authentication cookie.

The sample app sets the value of `SaveTokens` to `true` in [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect.OpenIdConnectOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect.OpenIdConnectOptions):

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Program.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle2\&highlight=9)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Program.cs.md)

When `OnPostConfirmationAsync` executes, store the access token ([ExternalLoginInfo.AuthenticationTokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.ExternalLoginInfo.AuthenticationTokens*)) from the external provider in the `ApplicationUser`'s `AuthenticationProperties`.

The sample app saves the access token in `OnPostConfirmationAsync` (new user registration) and `OnGetCallbackAsync` (previously registered user) in `Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs`:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_OnPostConfirmationAsync\&highlight=49-53,73)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs.md)

> **Note:**
> For information on passing tokens to the Razor components of a server-side Blazor app, see [blazor/security/additional-scenarios#pass-tokens-to-a-server-side-blazor-app](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=blazor%2Fsecurity%2Fadditional-scenarios%23pass-tokens-to-a-server-side-blazor-app).

## How to add additional custom tokens

To demonstrate how to add a custom token, which is stored as part of `SaveTokens`, the sample app adds an [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationToken) with the current [System.DateTime](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.DateTime) for an [AuthenticationToken.Name](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationToken.Name*) of `TicketCreated`:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Program.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle2\&highlight=11-24)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Program.cs.md)

## Create and add claims

The framework provides common actions and extension methods for creating and adding claims to the collection. For more information, see the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions) and [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionUniqueExtensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionUniqueExtensions).

Users can define custom actions by deriving from [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction) and implementing the abstract [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.Run*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.Run*) method.

For more information, see [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims).

## Add and update user claims

Claims are copied from external providers to the user database on first registration, not on sign in. If additional claims are enabled in an app after a user registers to use the app, call [SignInManager.RefreshSignInAsync](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%25601) on a user to force the generation of a new authentication cookie.

In the `Development` environment working with test user accounts, delete and recreate the user account. For production systems, new claims added to the app can be backfilled into user accounts. After [scaffolding the `ExternalLogin` page](../scaffold-identity.md) into the app at `Areas/Pages/Identity/Account/Manage`, add the following code to the `ExternalLoginModel` in the `ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs` file.

Add a dictionary of added claims. Use the dictionary keys to hold the claim types, and use the values to hold a default value. Add the following line to the top of the class. The following example assumes that one claim is added for the user's Google picture with a generic headshot image as the default value:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_dict\&highlight=49-53)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs.md)

Replace the default code of the `OnGetCallbackAsync` method with the following code. The code loops through the claims dictionary. Claims are added (backfilled) or updated for each user. When claims are added or updated, the user sign-in is refreshed using the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%601](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%25601), preserving the existing authentication properties (`AuthenticationProperties`).

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_both\&highlight=27-69)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/6.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs.md)

A similar approach is taken when claims change while a user is signed in but a backfill step isn't required. To update a user's claims, call the following on the user:

* [UserManager.ReplaceClaimAsync](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UserManager%25601) on the user for claims stored in the identity database.
* [SignInManager.RefreshSignInAsync](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%25601) on the user to force the generation of a new authentication cookie.

## Remove claim actions and claims

[ClaimActionCollection.Remove(String)](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimActionCollection.Remove*) removes all claim actions for the given [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType) from the collection. [ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim(ClaimActionCollection, String)](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim*) deletes a claim of the given [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType) from the identity. [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim*) is primarily used with [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc) to remove protocol-generated claims.

## Forward request information with a proxy or load balancer

If the app is deployed behind a proxy server or load balancer, some of the original request information might be forwarded to the app in request headers. This information usually includes the secure request scheme (`https`), host, and client IP address. Apps don't automatically read these request headers to discover and use the original request information.

The scheme is used in link generation that affects the authentication flow with external providers. Losing the secure scheme (`https`) results in the app generating incorrect insecure redirect URLs.

Use forwarded headers middleware to make the original request information available to the app for request processing.

For more information, see [host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer](../../../host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer.md).

**Applies to: \>= aspnetcore-3.0 < aspnetcore-6.0**

An ASP.NET Core app can establish additional claims and tokens from external authentication providers, such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter. Each provider reveals different information about users on its platform, but the pattern for receiving and transforming user data into additional claims is the same.

[View or download sample code](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples) ([how to download](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Findex%23how-to-download-a-sample))

## Prerequisites

Decide which external authentication providers to support in the app. For each provider, register the app and obtain a client ID and client secret. For more information, see [security/authentication/social/index](index.md). The sample app uses the [Google authentication provider](google-logins.md).

## Set the client ID and client secret

The OAuth authentication provider establishes a trust relationship with an app using a client ID and client secret. Client ID and client secret values are created for the app by the external authentication provider when the app is registered with the provider. Each external provider that the app uses must be configured independently with the provider's client ID and client secret. For more information, see the external authentication provider topics that apply to your scenario:

* [Facebook authentication](facebook-logins.md)
* [Google authentication](google-logins.md)
* [Microsoft authentication](microsoft-logins.md)
* [Twitter authentication](twitter-logins.md)
* [Other authentication providers](other-logins.md)
* [OpenIdConnect](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2)

Optional claims sent in the ID or access token from the authentication provider are usually configured in the provider's online portal. For example, Microsoft Entra ID permits you to assign optional claims to the app's ID token in the app registration's **Token configuration** blade. For more information, see [How to: Provide optional claims to your app (Azure documentation)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-optional-claims). For other providers, consult their external documentation sets.

The sample app configures the Google authentication provider with a client ID and client secret provided by Google:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle\&highlight=4,9)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs.md)

## Establish the authentication scope

Specify the list of permissions to retrieve from the provider by specifying the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthOptions.Scope*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthOptions.Scope*). Authentication scopes for common external providers appear in the following table.

| Provider | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Facebook | `https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth` |
| Google | `profile`, `email`, `openid` |
| Microsoft | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize` |
| Twitter | `https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate` |

In the sample app, Google's `profile`, `email`, and `openid` scopes are automatically added by the framework when [Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.GoogleExtensions.AddGoogle%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.GoogleExtensions.AddGoogle%252A) is called on the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilder). If the app requires additional scopes, add them to the options. In the following example, the Google `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/user.birthday.read` scope is added to retrieve a user's birthday:

```csharp
options.Scope.Add("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/user.birthday.read");
```

## Map user data keys and create claims

In the provider's options, specify a [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonKey*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonKey*) or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonSubKey*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonSubKey*) for each key/subkey in the external provider's JSON user data for the app identity to read on sign in. For more information on claim types, see [System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes).

The sample app creates locale (`urn:google:locale`) and picture (`urn:google:picture`) claims from the `locale` and `picture` keys in Google user data:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle\&highlight=13-14)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs.md)

In `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UI.Pages.Account.Internal.ExternalLoginModel.OnPostConfirmationAsync`, an [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityUser](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityUser) (`ApplicationUser`) is signed into the app with [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%601.SignInAsync*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%25601.SignInAsync*). During the sign in process, the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UserManager%601](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UserManager%25601) can store an `ApplicationUser` claims for user data available from the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.ExternalLoginInfo.Principal*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.ExternalLoginInfo.Principal*).

In the sample app, `OnPostConfirmationAsync` (`Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs`) establishes the locale (`urn:google:locale`) and picture (`urn:google:picture`) claims for the signed in `ApplicationUser`, including a claim for [System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes.GivenName](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes.GivenName):

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_OnPostConfirmationAsync\&highlight=35-51)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs.md)

By default, a user's claims are stored in the authentication cookie. If the authentication cookie is too large, it can cause the app to fail because:

* The browser detects that the cookie header is too long.
* The overall size of the request is too large.

If a large amount of user data is required for processing user requests:

* Limit the number and size of user claims for request processing to only what the app requires.
* Use a custom [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.ITicketStore](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.ITicketStore) for the cookie authentication middleware's [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.SessionStore](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.SessionStore) to store identity across requests. Preserve large quantities of identity information on the server while only sending a small session identifier key to the client.

## Save the access token

[Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.RemoteAuthenticationOptions.SaveTokens*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.RemoteAuthenticationOptions.SaveTokens*) defines whether access and refresh tokens should be stored in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Authentication.AuthenticationProperties](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Authentication.AuthenticationProperties) after a successful authorization. `SaveTokens` is set to `false` by default to reduce the size of the final authentication cookie.

The sample app sets the value of `SaveTokens` to `true` in [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google.GoogleOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google.GoogleOptions):

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle\&highlight=15)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs.md)

When `OnPostConfirmationAsync` executes, store the access token ([ExternalLoginInfo.AuthenticationTokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.ExternalLoginInfo.AuthenticationTokens*)) from the external provider in the `ApplicationUser`'s `AuthenticationProperties`.

The sample app saves the access token in `OnPostConfirmationAsync` (new user registration) and `OnGetCallbackAsync` (previously registered user) in `Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs`:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_OnPostConfirmationAsync\&highlight=54-56)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs.md)

> **Note:**
> For information on passing tokens to the Razor components of a server-side Blazor app, see [blazor/security/additional-scenarios#pass-tokens-to-a-server-side-blazor-app](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=blazor%2Fsecurity%2Fadditional-scenarios%23pass-tokens-to-a-server-side-blazor-app).

## How to add additional custom tokens

To demonstrate how to add a custom token, which is stored as part of `SaveTokens`, the sample app adds an [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationToken) with the current [System.DateTime](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.DateTime) for an [AuthenticationToken.Name](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationToken.Name*) of `TicketCreated`:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle\&highlight=17-30)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/3.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs.md)

## Creating and adding claims

The framework provides common actions and extension methods for creating and adding claims to the collection. For more information, see the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions) and [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionUniqueExtensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionUniqueExtensions).

Users can define custom actions by deriving from [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction) and implementing the abstract [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.Run*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.Run*) method.

For more information, see [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims).

## Add and update user claims

Claims are copied from external providers to the user database on first registration, not on sign in. If additional claims are enabled in an app after a user registers to use the app, call [SignInManager.RefreshSignInAsync](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%25601) on a user to force the generation of a new authentication cookie.

In the `Development` environment working with test user accounts, you can simply delete and recreate the user account. For production systems, new claims added to the app can be backfilled into user accounts. After [scaffolding the `ExternalLogin` page](../scaffold-identity.md) into the app at `Areas/Pages/Identity/Account/Manage`, add the following code to the `ExternalLoginModel` in the `ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs` file.

Add a dictionary of added claims. Use the dictionary keys to hold the claim types, and use the values to hold a default value. Add the following line to the top of the class. The following example assumes that one claim is added for the user's Google picture with a generic headshot image as the default value:

```csharp
private readonly IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string> _claimsToSync = 
    new Dictionary<string, string>()
    {
        { "urn:google:picture", "https://localhost:5001/headshot.png" },
    };
```

Replace the default code of the `OnGetCallbackAsync` method with the following code. The code loops through the claims dictionary. Claims are added (backfilled) or updated for each user. When claims are added or updated, the user sign-in is refreshed using the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%601](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%25601), preserving the existing authentication properties (`AuthenticationProperties`).

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> OnGetCallbackAsync(

        return Page();
    }
}
```

A similar approach is taken when claims change while a user is signed in but a backfill step isn't required. To update a user's claims, call the following on the user:

* [UserManager.ReplaceClaimAsync](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UserManager%25601) on the user for claims stored in the identity database.
* [SignInManager.RefreshSignInAsync](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%25601) on the user to force the generation of a new authentication cookie.

## Removal of claim actions and claims

[ClaimActionCollection.Remove(String)](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimActionCollection.Remove*) removes all claim actions for the given [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType) from the collection. [ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim(ClaimActionCollection, String)](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim*) deletes a claim of the given [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType) from the identity. [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim*) is primarily used with [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc) to remove protocol-generated claims.

## Forward request information with a proxy or load balancer

If the app is deployed behind a proxy server or load balancer, some of the original request information might be forwarded to the app in request headers. This information usually includes the secure request scheme (`https`), host, and client IP address. Apps don't automatically read these request headers to discover and use the original request information.

The scheme is used in link generation that affects the authentication flow with external providers. Losing the secure scheme (`https`) results in the app generating incorrect insecure redirect URLs.

Use forwarded headers middleware to make the original request information available to the app for request processing.

For more information, see [host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer](../../../host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer.md).




**Applies to: < aspnetcore-3.0**

An ASP.NET Core app can establish additional claims and tokens from external authentication providers, such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Twitter. Each provider reveals different information about users on its platform, but the pattern for receiving and transforming user data into additional claims is the same.

[View or download sample code](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/tree/main/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples) ([how to download](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Findex%23how-to-download-a-sample))

## Prerequisites

Decide which external authentication providers to support in the app. For each provider, register the app and obtain a client ID and client secret. For more information, see [security/authentication/social/index](index.md). The sample app uses the [Google authentication provider](google-logins.md).

## Set the client ID and client secret

The OAuth authentication provider establishes a trust relationship with an app using a client ID and client secret. Client ID and client secret values are created for the app by the external authentication provider when the app is registered with the provider. Each external provider that the app uses must be configured independently with the provider's client ID and client secret. For more information, see the external authentication provider topics that apply to your scenario:

* [Facebook authentication](facebook-logins.md)
* [Google authentication](google-logins.md)
* [Microsoft authentication](microsoft-logins.md)
* [Twitter authentication](twitter-logins.md)
* [Other authentication providers](other-logins.md)
* [OpenIdConnect](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2)

The sample app configures the Google authentication provider with a client ID and client secret provided by Google:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle\&highlight=4,9)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs.md)

## Establish the authentication scope

Specify the list of permissions to retrieve from the provider by specifying the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthOptions.Scope*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.OAuthOptions.Scope*). Authentication scopes for common external providers appear in the following table.

| Provider | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Facebook | `https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth` |
| Google | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile` |
| Microsoft | `https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize` |
| Twitter | `https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate` |

In the sample app, Google's `userinfo.profile` scope is automatically added by the framework when [Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.GoogleExtensions.AddGoogle*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.GoogleExtensions.AddGoogle*) is called on the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilder](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationBuilder). If the app requires additional scopes, add them to the options. In the following example, the Google `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/user.birthday.read` scope is added in order to retrieve a user's birthday:

```csharp
options.Scope.Add("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/user.birthday.read");
```

## Map user data keys and create claims

In the provider's options, specify a [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonKey*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonKey*) or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonSubKey*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.MapJsonSubKey*) for each key/subkey in the external provider's JSON user data for the app identity to read on sign in. For more information on claim types, see [System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes).

The sample app creates locale (`urn:google:locale`) and picture (`urn:google:picture`) claims from the `locale` and `picture` keys in Google user data:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle\&highlight=13-14)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs.md)

In `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UI.Pages.Account.Internal.ExternalLoginModel.OnPostConfirmationAsync`, an [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityUser](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.IdentityUser) (`ApplicationUser`) is signed into the app with [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%601.SignInAsync*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.SignInManager%25601.SignInAsync*). During the sign in process, the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UserManager%601](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.UserManager%25601) can store an `ApplicationUser` claims for user data available from the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.ExternalLoginInfo.Principal*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.ExternalLoginInfo.Principal*).

In the sample app, `OnPostConfirmationAsync` (`Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs`) establishes the locale (`urn:google:locale`) and picture (`urn:google:picture`) claims for the signed in `ApplicationUser`, including a claim for [System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes.GivenName](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.Security.Claims.ClaimTypes.GivenName):

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_OnPostConfirmationAsync\&highlight=35-51)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs.md)

By default, a user's claims are stored in the authentication cookie. If the authentication cookie is too large, it can cause the app to fail because:

* The browser detects that the cookie header is too long.
* The overall size of the request is too large.

If a large amount of user data is required for processing user requests:

* Limit the number and size of user claims for request processing to only what the app requires.
* Use a custom [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.ITicketStore](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.ITicketStore) for the cookie authentication middleware's [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.SessionStore](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationOptions.SessionStore) to store identity across requests. Preserve large quantities of identity information on the server while only sending a small session identifier key to the client.

## Save the access token

[Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.RemoteAuthenticationOptions.SaveTokens*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.RemoteAuthenticationOptions.SaveTokens*) defines whether access and refresh tokens should be stored in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Authentication.AuthenticationProperties](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Authentication.AuthenticationProperties) after a successful authorization. `SaveTokens` is set to `false` by default to reduce the size of the final authentication cookie.

The sample app sets the value of `SaveTokens` to `true` in [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google.GoogleOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Google.GoogleOptions):

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle\&highlight=15)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs.md)

When `OnPostConfirmationAsync` executes, store the access token ([ExternalLoginInfo.AuthenticationTokens](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.ExternalLoginInfo.AuthenticationTokens*)) from the external provider in the `ApplicationUser`'s `AuthenticationProperties`.

The sample app saves the access token in `OnPostConfirmationAsync` (new user registration) and `OnGetCallbackAsync` (previously registered user) in `Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs`:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs?name=snippet_OnPostConfirmationAsync\&highlight=54-56)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/ExternalLogin.cshtml.cs.md)

## How to add additional custom tokens

To demonstrate how to add a custom token, which is stored as part of `SaveTokens`, the sample app adds an [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationToken](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationToken) with the current [System.DateTime](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.DateTime) for an [AuthenticationToken.Name](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AuthenticationToken.Name*) of `TicketCreated`:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs?name=snippet_AddGoogle\&highlight=17-30)](../../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/social/additional-claims/samples/2.x/ClaimsSample/Startup.cs.md)

## Creating and adding claims

The framework provides common actions and extension methods for creating and adding claims to the collection. For more information, see the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions) and [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionUniqueExtensions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionUniqueExtensions).

Users can define custom actions by deriving from [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction) and implementing the abstract [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.Run*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.Run*) method.

For more information, see [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims).

## Removal of claim actions and claims

[ClaimActionCollection.Remove(String)](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimActionCollection.Remove*) removes all claim actions for the given [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType) from the collection. [ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim(ClaimActionCollection, String)](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim*) deletes a claim of the given [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OAuth.Claims.ClaimAction.ClaimType) from the identity. [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim*](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.ClaimActionCollectionMapExtensions.DeleteClaim*) is primarily used with [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc) to remove protocol-generated claims.
