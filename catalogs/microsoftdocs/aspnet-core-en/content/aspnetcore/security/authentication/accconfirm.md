# Account confirmation and password recovery in ASP.NET Core

By [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT), [Ponant](https://github.com/Ponant), and [Joe Audette](https://twitter.com/joeaudette)

This tutorial shows how to build an ASP.NET Core app with email confirmation and password reset. This tutorial is **not** a beginning article. You should be familiar with:

* [Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core](../../tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start.md)
* [Authentication](identity.md)
* [Entity Framework Core](../../data/ef-mvc/intro.md)

**Applies to: \>= aspnetcore-8.0**

For Blazor guidance, which adds to or supersedes the guidance in this article, see the following resources:

* [blazor/security/account-confirmation-and-password-recovery](../../blazor/security/account-confirmation-and-password-recovery.md)
* [blazor/security/webassembly/standalone-with-identity/account-confirmation-and-password-recovery](../../blazor/security/webassembly/standalone-with-identity/account-confirmation-and-password-recovery.md)



<!-- see Dropbox/wrk/Code/SendGridConsole/Program.cs -->

**Applies to: \>= aspnetcore-6.0**

## Prerequisites

* [.NET 6 or later SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
* Successfully [send email from a C# console app by using the SendGrid API (Twilio)](https://www.twilio.com/blog/send-emails-using-the-sendgrid-api-with-dotnetnet-6-and-csharp)

## Create and test a web app with authentication

Run the following commands to create a web app with authentication:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new webapp -au Individual -o WebPWrecover
cd WebPWrecover
dotnet run
```

### Register a user with simulated email confirmation

Run the app, select the **Register** link, and register a user.

After registration completes, you're redirected to the `/Identity/Account/RegisterConfirmation` page, which contains a link to simulate email confirmation.

1. Select the `Click here to confirm your account` link.

1. Select the **Login** link and sign-in with the same credentials.

1. Select the `Hello YourEmail@provider.com!` link, which redirects to the `/Identity/Account/Manage/PersonalData` page.

1. Select the **Personal data** tab, and then select **Delete**.

The `Click here to confirm your account` link displays because the [IEmailSender](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/1dcf7acfacf0fe154adcc23270cb0da11ff44ace/src/Identity/UI/src/Areas/Identity/Services/EmailSender.cs) interface isn't yet implemented and registered with the [dependency injection container](../../fundamentals/dependency-injection.md). For more information, see the [RegisterConfirmation source](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Identity/UI/src/Areas/Identity/Pages/V4/Account/RegisterConfirmation.cshtml.cs#L71-L74).

> **Note:**
> Documentation links to .NET reference source usually load the repository's default branch, which represents the current development for the next release of .NET. To select a tag for a specific release, use the **Switch branches or tags** dropdown list. For more information, see [How to select a version tag of ASP.NET Core source code (dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs #26205)](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/discussions/26205).


### Configure an email provider

<!-- Locale identifier (en-us) required in next link -->

In this tutorial, Twilio [SendGrid](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/sendgrid) is used to send email. A SendGrid account and key are required to send email. We recommend using SendGrid or another email service to send email rather than SMTP. SMTP is difficult to secure and set up correctly.

The SendGrid account might require [adding a Sender](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/senders/).

Create a class to fetch the secure email key. For this sample, create the _Services/AuthMessageSenderOptions.cs_ file:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Services/AuthMessageSenderOptions.cs)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Services/AuthMessageSenderOptions.cs.md)

#### Configure SendGrid user secrets

Set the `SendGridKey` value with the [secret-manager tool](../app-secrets.md). For example:

```dotnetcli
dotnet user-secrets set SendGridKey <key>

Successfully saved SendGridKey to the secret store.
```

On Windows, Secret Manager stores keys/value pairs in a _secrets.json_ file in the `%APPDATA%/Microsoft/UserSecrets/<WebAppName-userSecretsId>` directory.

The contents of the _secrets.json_ file aren't encrypted. The following markup shows the _secrets.json_ file. The `SendGridKey` value is removed from the example.

```json
{
  "SendGridKey": "<key removed>"
}
```

For more information, see the [Options pattern](../../fundamentals/configuration/options.md) and [fundamentals/configuration/index](../../fundamentals/configuration/index.md).

### Install SendGrid

This tutorial shows how to add email notifications through [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), but other email providers can be used.

Install the `SendGrid` NuGet package:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

From the Package Manager Console, enter the following command:

```powershell
Install-Package SendGrid
```

# [.NET CLI](#tab/net-cli)

From the console, enter the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package SendGrid
```

To register for a free SendGrid account, [start sending with a free SendGrid Email API trial](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/products/email-api/pricing).

### Implement IEmailSender

To implement the `IEmailSender` interface, create the _Services/EmailSender.cs_ file with code similar to the following example:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Services/EmailSender.cs)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Services/EmailSender.cs.md)

### Configure the app to support email

Add the following code to the _Program.cs_ file, which performs the following tasks:

* Adds the `EmailSender` instance as a transient service.
* Registers the `AuthMessageSenderOptions` configuration instance.

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Program.cs?name=snippet1\&highlight=2,5,18-19)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Program.cs.md)

### Disable default account verification when Account.RegisterConfirmation is scaffolded

If `Account.RegisterConfirmation` is scaffolded, complete the instructions in this section.

> **Important:**
> If `Account.RegisterConfirmation` is **not** scaffolded, skip the following instructions and continue to the next section.

The user is redirected to the `/Identity/Account/RegisterConfirmation` page where they can select a link to have the account confirmed. The default `Account.RegisterConfirmation` is used ***only*** for testing. Automatic account verification should be disabled in a production app.

To require a confirmed account and prevent immediate sign in at registration, set `DisplayConfirmAccountLink = false` in the scaffolded _/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/RegisterConfirmation.cshtml.cs_ file:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: ../../includes/~/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/RegisterConfirmation.cshtml.cs?highlight=63](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm.md)

This step is necessary only when `Account.RegisterConfirmation` is scaffolded.

The non-scaffolded [RegisterConfirmation](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/1dcf7acfacf0fe154adcc23270cb0da11ff44ace/src/Identity/UI/src/Areas/Identity/Pages/V4/Account/RegisterConfirmation.cshtml.cs#L74-L87) automatically detects when an [IEmailSender](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/1dcf7acfacf0fe154adcc23270cb0da11ff44ace/src/Identity/UI/src/Areas/Identity/Services/EmailSender.cs) is implemented and registered with the [dependency injection container](../../fundamentals/dependency-injection.md).


## Register, confirm email, and reset password

Run the web app, and test the account confirmation and password recovery flow.

1. Run the app and register a new user.

1. Check your email for the account confirmation link. If you don't receive the email, see the [Debug email](#debug-email) section for troubleshooting.

1. Select the link and confirm your email.

1. Sign in with your email and password.

1. Sign out.

### Test password reset

1. If you're signed in, select **Logout**.

1. Select the **Log in** link, and then select the **Forgot your password?** link.

1. Enter the email you used to register the account. The app sends an email with a link to reset your password.

1. Go to the sent email message.

1. Select the link and reset your password.

After your password successfully resets, you can sign in with your email and new password.

## Resend email confirmation

This section describes the code that supports the email confirmation process and related tasks.

* Start by selecting the **Resend email confirmation** link on the **Login** page.

### Change email and activity timeout

The default inactivity timeout is 14 days. The following code sets the inactivity timeout to five days:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Program.cs?name=snippet_timeout\&highlight=21-24)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Program.cs.md)

### Change all data protection token lifespans

The following code changes the timeout period for all data protection tokens to three hours:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Program.cs?name=snippet_dpt\&highlight=21-22)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Program.cs.md)

The built-in Identity user tokens (see the [AspNetCore/src/Identity/Extensions.Core/src/TokenOptions.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/blob/v2.2.2/src/Identity/Extensions.Core/src/TokenOptions.cs) source) have a [one day timeout](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/blob/v2.2.2/src/Identity/Core/src/DataProtectionTokenProviderOptions.cs).

### Change the email token lifespan

The default token lifespan of [the Identity user tokens](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/blob/v2.2.2/src/Identity/Extensions.Core/src/TokenOptions.cs) is [one day](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/blob/v2.2.2/src/Identity/Core/src/DataProtectionTokenProviderOptions.cs).

The following code shows how to change the email token lifespan.

Add a custom [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.DataProtectorTokenProvider%601](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.DataProtectorTokenProvider%25601) class and [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.DataProtectionTokenProviderOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.DataProtectionTokenProviderOptions) class:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/TokenProviders/CustomTokenProvider.cs?name=snippet1)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/TokenProviders/CustomTokenProvider.cs.md)

Add the custom provider to the service container:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Program.cs?name=snippet_etl\&highlight=18-24)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Program.cs.md)

### Debug email

If the email process isn't working as expected, try these troubleshooting steps:

* Set a breakpoint in the `EmailSender.Execute` method and verify the `SendGridClient.SendEmailAsync` method is called.

* Create a [console app to send email](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/for-developers/sending-email/v2-csharp-code-example) by using similar code to `EmailSender.Execute`.

* Review the [Email Activity](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sendgrid/ui/analytics-and-reporting/email-activity-feed) page.

* Check your spam folder.

* Try another email alias on a different email provider, such as Microsoft, Yahoo, Gmail, and so on.

* Try sending to different email accounts.

> **Tip:**
> **A security best practice** is to **not** use production secrets in test and development. If you publish the app to Azure, set the SendGrid secrets as application settings in the Azure Web App portal. The configuration system is set up to read keys from environment variables.

## Combine social and local login accounts

To complete this section, you must first enable an external authentication provider. For more information, see [security/authentication/social/index](social/index.md).

In this sequence, the email address `RickAndMSFT@gmail.com` is first created as a local login. However, you can create the account as a social login first, and then add a local login.

1. To combine local and social accounts, select the email address link.

   Screenshot that shows how to select the email address link for the authenticated user in the web app.

1. In the **Manage your account** page, select the **Manage** link.

   Notice there are currently zero (0) external (social logins) associated with the authenticated account.

   Screenshot that shows zero external (social logins) associated with the authenticated account. The Management link is highlighted.

1. In the **Manage your external logins** page, select the link to another login service. Follow the service prompts and accept the app requests.

   In the following image, Facebook is added as an external authentication provider:

   Screenshot that shows Facebook added as an external (social) login for the authenticated account.

Authentication for the user email address now combines local and external (social) accounts. The user can sign in with either account.

> **Tip:**
> It's a good practice to recommend your users to add a local account to your app. This approach can help ensure continued access in case their social login authentication service is down, or they lose access to their social account.

## Enable account confirmation after a site has users

If you enable account confirmation on a site with existing users, you lock them out because their accounts aren't confirmed.

To work around the issue of existing user lockout, use one of the following approaches:

* Update the database to mark all existing users as confirmed.

* Confirm existing users. For example, batch-send emails with confirmation links.



**Applies to: < aspnetcore-6.0**

## Prerequisites

[.NET Core 3.0 or later SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)

## Create and test a web app with authentication

Run the following commands to create a web app with authentication.

```dotnetcli
dotnet new webapp -au Individual -uld -o WebPWrecover
cd WebPWrecover
dotnet run
```

Run the app, select the **Register** link, and register a user. Once registered, you are redirected to the to `/Identity/Account/RegisterConfirmation` page which contains a link to simulate email confirmation:

* Select the `Click here to confirm your account` link.
* Select the **Login** link and sign-in with the same credentials.
* Select the `Hello YourEmail@provider.com!` link, which redirects you to the `/Identity/Account/Manage/PersonalData` page.
* Select the **Personal data** tab on the left, and then select **Delete**.

### Configure an email provider

In this tutorial, [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) is used to send email. You can use other email providers. We recommend you use SendGrid or another email service to send email. SMTP is difficult to configure so mail is not marked as spam.

The SendGrid account may require [adding a Sender](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/sending-email/senders/).

Create a class to fetch the secure email key. For this sample, create `Services/AuthMessageSenderOptions.cs`:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Services/AuthMessageSenderOptions.cs)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Services/AuthMessageSenderOptions.cs.md)

#### Configure SendGrid user secrets

Set the `SendGridKey` with the [secret-manager tool](../app-secrets.md). For example:

```dotnetcli
dotnet user-secrets set SendGridKey <SG.key>

Successfully saved SendGridKey = SG.keyVal to the secret store.
```

On Windows, Secret Manager stores keys/value pairs in a `secrets.json` file in the `%APPDATA%/Microsoft/UserSecrets/<WebAppName-userSecretsId>` directory.

The contents of the `secrets.json` file aren't encrypted. The following markup shows the `secrets.json` file. The `SendGridKey` value has been removed.

```json
{
  "SendGridKey": "<key removed>"
}
```

For more information, see the [Options pattern](../../fundamentals/configuration/options.md) and [configuration](../../fundamentals/configuration/index.md).

### Install SendGrid

This tutorial shows how to add email notifications through [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), but you can send email using SMTP and other mechanisms.

Install the `SendGrid` NuGet package:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

From the Package Manager Console, enter the following command:

```powershell
Install-Package SendGrid
```

# [.NET CLI](#tab/net-cli)

From the console, enter the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package SendGrid
```

### Implement IEmailSender

To Implement `IEmailSender`, create `Services/EmailSender.cs` with code similar to the following:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Services/EmailSender.cs)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Services/EmailSender.cs.md)

### Configure startup to support email

Add the following code to the `ConfigureServices` method in the `Startup.cs` file:

* Add `EmailSender` as a transient service.
* Register the `AuthMessageSenderOptions` configuration instance.

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Program.cs?name=snippet1\&highlight=2,5,19-20)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover60/Program.cs.md)

## Scaffold RegisterConfirmation

Follow the instructions for [Scaffold Identity](scaffold-identity.md) and scaffold `Account\RegisterConfirmation`.

<!-- .NET 5 fixes this, see
https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/src/Identity/UI/src/Areas/Identity/Pages/V4/Account/RegisterConfirmation.cshtml.cs#L74-L77
-->

### Disable default account verification when Account.RegisterConfirmation is scaffolded

If `Account.RegisterConfirmation` is scaffolded, complete the instructions in this section.

> **Important:**
> If `Account.RegisterConfirmation` is **not** scaffolded, skip the following instructions and continue to the next section.

The user is redirected to the `/Identity/Account/RegisterConfirmation` page where they can select a link to have the account confirmed. The default `Account.RegisterConfirmation` is used ***only*** for testing. Automatic account verification should be disabled in a production app.

To require a confirmed account and prevent immediate sign in at registration, set `DisplayConfirmAccountLink = false` in the scaffolded _/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/RegisterConfirmation.cshtml.cs_ file:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: ../../includes/~/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/RegisterConfirmation.cshtml.cs?highlight=63](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm.md)

This step is necessary only when `Account.RegisterConfirmation` is scaffolded.

The non-scaffolded [RegisterConfirmation](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/1dcf7acfacf0fe154adcc23270cb0da11ff44ace/src/Identity/UI/src/Areas/Identity/Pages/V4/Account/RegisterConfirmation.cshtml.cs#L74-L87) automatically detects when an [IEmailSender](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/1dcf7acfacf0fe154adcc23270cb0da11ff44ace/src/Identity/UI/src/Areas/Identity/Services/EmailSender.cs) is implemented and registered with the [dependency injection container](../../fundamentals/dependency-injection.md).


## Register, confirm email, and reset password

Run the web app, and test the account confirmation and password recovery flow.

* Run the app and register a new user
* Check your email for the account confirmation link. See [Debug email](#debug) if you don't get the email.
* Click the link to confirm your email.
* Sign in with your email and password.
* Sign out.

### Test password reset

* If you're signed in, select **Logout**.
* Select the **Log in** link and select the **Forgot your password?** link.
* Enter the email you used to register the account.
* An email with a link to reset your password is sent. Check your email and click the link to reset your password. After your password has been successfully reset, you can sign in with your email and new password.

<a name="resend"></a>

## Resend email confirmation

In .NET 5 or later, select the **Resend email confirmation** link on the **Login** page.

### Change email and activity timeout

The default inactivity timeout is 14 days. The following code sets the inactivity timeout to 5 days:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover30/StartupAppCookie.cs?name=snippet1)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover30/StartupAppCookie.cs.md)

### Change all data protection token lifespans

The following code changes all data protection tokens timeout period to 3 hours:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover30/StartupAllTokens.cs?name=snippet1\&highlight=11-12)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover30/StartupAllTokens.cs.md)

The built in Identity user tokens (see [AspNetCore/src/Identity/Extensions.Core/src/TokenOptions.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/blob/v2.2.2/src/Identity/Extensions.Core/src/TokenOptions.cs) )have a [one day timeout](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/blob/v2.2.2/src/Identity/Core/src/DataProtectionTokenProviderOptions.cs).

### Change the email token lifespan

The default token lifespan of [the Identity user tokens](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/blob/v2.2.2/src/Identity/Extensions.Core/src/TokenOptions.cs) is [one day](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/blob/v2.2.2/src/Identity/Core/src/DataProtectionTokenProviderOptions.cs). This section shows how to change the email token lifespan.

Add a custom [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.DataProtectorTokenProvider%601](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.DataProtectorTokenProvider%25601) and [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.DataProtectionTokenProviderOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.DataProtectionTokenProviderOptions):

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover30/TokenProviders/CustomTokenProvider.cs?name=snippet1)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover30/TokenProviders/CustomTokenProvider.cs.md)

Add the custom provider to the service container:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover30/StartupEmail.cs?name=snippet1\&highlight=10-16)](../../../_code/aspnetcore/security/authentication/accconfirm/sample/WebPWrecover30/StartupEmail.cs.md)

<a name="debug"></a>

### Debug email

If you can't get email working:

* Set a breakpoint in `EmailSender.Execute` to verify `SendGridClient.SendEmailAsync` is called.
* Create a [console app to send email](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Integrate/Code_Examples/v2_Mail/csharp.html) using similar code to `EmailSender.Execute`.
* Review the [Email Activity](https://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/email_activity.html) page.
* Check your spam folder.
* Try another email alias on a different email provider (Microsoft, Yahoo, Gmail, etc.)
* Try sending to different email accounts.

**A security best practice** is to **not** use production secrets in test and development. If you publish the app to Azure, set the SendGrid secrets as application settings in the Azure Web App portal. The configuration system is set up to read keys from environment variables.

## Combine social and local login accounts

To complete this section, you must first enable an external authentication provider. See [Facebook, Google, and external provider authentication](social/index.md).

You can combine local and social accounts by clicking on your email link. In the following sequence, "RickAndMSFT@gmail.com" is first created as a local login; however, you can create the account as a social login first, then add a local login.

Web application: RickAndMSFT\@gmail.com user authenticated

Click on the **Manage** link. Note the 0 external (social logins) associated with this account.

Manage view

Click the link to another login service and accept the app requests. In the following image, Facebook is the external authentication provider:

Manage your external logins view listing Facebook

The two accounts have been combined. You are able to sign in with either account. You might want your users to add local accounts in case their social login authentication service is down, or more likely they've lost access to their social account.

## Enable account confirmation after a site has users

Enabling account confirmation on a site with users locks out all the existing users. Existing users are locked out because their accounts aren't confirmed. To work around existing user lockout, use one of the following approaches:

* Update the database to mark all existing users as being confirmed.
* Confirm existing users. For example, batch-send emails with confirmation links.
