# Enforce HTTPS in ASP.NET Core

By [David Galvan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-galvan/) and [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

To enforce incoming requests to your ASP.NET Core apps to use HTTPS/TLS, you can:

* Require HTTPS for all requests.
* Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

No API can prevent a client from sending sensitive data on the first request.

This article describes how to configure your ASP.NET Core apps to require HTTPS/TLS or redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS/TLS for secure interaction. Troubleshooting steps are provided for various platforms to resolve untrusted certificate issues.

**Applies to: \>= aspnetcore-9.0**

## API projects

Projects that use Web APIs should either:

* Not listen on HTTP.
* Close the connection with status code 400 (Bad Request) and not serve the request.

To disable HTTP redirection in an API, set the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable or use the `--urls` command line flag. For more information, see [fundamentals/environments](../fundamentals/environments.md) and [8 ways to set the URLs for an ASP.NET Core app](https://andrewlock.net/8-ways-to-set-the-urls-for-an-aspnetcore-app/) by Andrew Lock.

> **Warning:**
> Do **not** use [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequireHttpsAttribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequireHttpsAttribute) on Web APIs that receive sensitive information.
> `RequireHttpsAttribute` uses HTTP status codes to redirect browsers from HTTP to HTTPS.
> API clients might not understand or obey redirects from HTTP to HTTPS, and they might send information over HTTP.

### HSTS and API projects

The secure approach for [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocol](#hsts) is to configure API projects to only listen to and respond over HTTPS.

> **Warning:**
> The default API projects don't include [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) because it's generally a browser only instruction. Other callers, such as phone or desktop apps, do **not** obey the instruction. Even within browsers, a single authenticated call to an API over HTTP has risks on insecure networks.

### HTTP redirect to HTTPS (ERR_INVALID_REDIRECT on CORS preflight request)

When a request to an endpoint using HTTP is redirected to HTTPS with the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A) method, the redirection fails with the `ERR_INVALID_REDIRECT` error on the CORS preflight request.

API projects can reject HTTP requests rather than use the `UseHttpsRedirection` method to redirect requests to HTTPS.

## Require HTTPS

For production ASP.NET Core web apps, the following approach is recommended:

* To redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS, use HTTPS redirection middleware ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A)).

* To send HSTS headers to clients, use HSTS middleware via the [UseHsts](#hsts) method.

> **Note:**
> Apps deployed in a reverse proxy configuration allow the proxy to handle connection security (HTTPS). If the proxy also handles HTTPS redirection, there's no need to use HTTPS redirection middleware. If the proxy server also handles writing HSTS headers (for example, [native HSTS support in Internet Information Services (IIS) 10.0 version 1709 or later](https://learn.microsoft.com/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-10-version-1709/iis-10-version-1709-hsts#iis-100-version-1709-native-hsts-support)), then the app doesn't require HSTS middleware. For more information, see [Opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS on project creation](#opt-out-of-httpshsts-on-project-creation).

### HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`)

The following code calls the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A) method in the _Program.cs_ file:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program.cs?highlight=13)](../../_code/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program.cs.md)

The preceding highlighted code:

* Uses the default [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode) property with the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect) code.
* Uses the default [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort) property (passing null), unless overridden by the `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature).

The recommended approach is to use temporary redirects rather than permanent redirects. Link caching can cause unstable behavior in development environments. If you prefer to send a permanent redirect status code when the app is in a non-`Development` environment, see the [Configure permanent redirects in production](#configure-permanent-redirects-in-production) section. Use [HSTS](#hsts) to signal to clients that only secure resource requests should be sent to the app (only in production).

> **Note:**
> Don't confuse the `HTTPS_PORT` configuration key and `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable, which set the port for HTTPS redirection middleware, with the `HTTPS_PORTS` configuration key and `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORTS` environment variable, which set the ports for Kestrel/HTTP.sys endpoint configuration.

### Port configuration

A port must be available for the middleware to redirect an insecure request to HTTPS. If no port is available:

* Redirection to HTTPS doesn't occur.
* The middleware logs the warning _Failed to determine the https port for redirect_.

Specify the HTTPS port by using any of the following approaches:

* Set [HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort](#options).
* Set the `https_port` [host setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fhost%2Fgeneric-host%23https-port):
   * In host configuration.
   * By setting the `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable.
   * By adding a top-level entry in the _appsettings.json_ file:

      [Code example (complete source file; reference: enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/appsettings.json?highlight=2)](../../_code/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/appsettings.json.md)

* Indicate a port with the secure scheme by using the [ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fhost%2Fgeneric-host%23server-urls). The environment variable configures the server. The middleware indirectly discovers the HTTPS port via [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature). This approach doesn't work in reverse proxy deployments.
* The ASP.NET Core web templates set an HTTPS URL in the _Properties/launchsettings.json_ file for both Kestrel and IIS Express. The _launchsettings.json_ file is used on the local machine only.
* Configure an HTTPS URL endpoint for a public-facing edge deployment of [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) server or [HTTP.sys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md) server. Only **one HTTPS port** is used by the app. The middleware discovers the port via [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature).

> **Note:**
> When an app runs in a reverse proxy configuration, [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature) isn't available. Set the port by using one of the other approaches described in this section.

### Edge deployments

When [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) or [HTTP.sys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md) is used as a public-facing edge server, Kestrel or HTTP.sys must be configured to listen on both:

* The secure port where the client is redirected (typically, 443 in production and 5001 in development).
* The insecure port (typically, 80 in production and 5000 in development).

The insecure port must be accessible by the client for the app to receive an insecure request and redirect the client to the secure port.

For more information, see [Kestrel endpoint configuration](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints.md) or [fundamentals/servers/httpsys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md).

### Deployment scenarios

Any firewall between the client and server must also have communication ports open for traffic.

If requests are forwarded in a reverse proxy configuration, use [forwarded headers middleware](../host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer.md) before calling HTTPS redirection middleware. Forwarded headers middleware updates the `Request.Scheme` by using the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. The middleware permits redirect URIs and other security policies to work correctly. When forwarded headers middleware isn't used, the back-end app might not receive the correct scheme and get caught in a redirect loop. A common end user error message is there are too many redirects.

When deploying to Azure App Service, follow the guidance in [Enable HTTPS for a custom domain in Azure App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-bindings).

### Options

The following highlighted code calls the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsRedirectionServicesExtensions.AddHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsRedirectionServicesExtensions.AddHttpsRedirection%252A) method to configure middleware options:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program2.cs?highlight=16-20)](../../_code/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program2.cs.md)

Calling `AddHttpsRedirection` is only necessary to change the values of `HttpsPort` or `RedirectStatusCode`.

The preceding highlighted code:

* Sets the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode%252A) property to the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect) code, which is the default value. Use the fields of the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes) class for assignments to `RedirectStatusCode`.
* Sets the HTTPS port to 5001.

#### Configure permanent redirects in production

The middleware defaults to sending a [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect) code with all redirects. If you prefer to send a permanent redirect status code when the app is in a non-`Development` environment, wrap the middleware options configuration in a conditional check for a non-`Development` environment.

The following code shows configuration of services in the _Program.cs_ file:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program3.cs?highlight=7-14)](../../_code/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program3.cs.md)

## HTTPS redirection middleware alternative approach

An alternative to using HTTPS redirection middleware (with the `UseHttpsRedirection` method) is to use URL rewriting middleware (via the `AddRedirectToHttps` method). `AddRedirectToHttps` can also set the status code and port when the redirect is executed. For more information, see [URL rewriting middleware](../fundamentals/url-rewriting.md).

When the app redirects to HTTPS without the requirement for other redirect rules, the recommendation is to use HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`) as described in this article.

## HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocol

Per [OWASP](https://owasp.org/about/), [HSTS](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) is an opt-in security enhancement specified by a web app via a response header. When a [browser that supports HSTS](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html#browser-support) receives this header:

* The browser stores configuration for the domain that prevents sending any communication over HTTP. The browser forces all communication over HTTPS.
* The browser prevents the user from using untrusted or invalid certificates. The browser disables prompts that allow a user to temporarily trust such a certificate.

Because the client enforces [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security), there are some limitations:

* The client must support HSTS.
* HSTS requires at least one successful HTTPS request to establish the HSTS policy.
* The application must check every HTTP request and redirect or reject the HTTP request.

ASP.NET Core implements HSTS with the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HstsBuilderExtensions.UseHsts%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HstsBuilderExtensions.UseHsts%252A) extension method. The following code calls `UseHsts` when the app isn't in [development mode](../fundamentals/environments.md):

[Code example (complete source file; reference: enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program.cs?highlight=10)](../../_code/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program.cs.md)

`UseHsts` isn't recommended in development because the HSTS settings are highly cacheable by browsers. By default, `UseHsts` excludes the local loopback address.

For production environments that are implementing HTTPS for the first time, set the initial [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HstsOptions.MaxAge%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HstsOptions.MaxAge%252A) property value to a small amount by using one of the [System.TimeSpan](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.TimeSpan) methods. Set the value from hours to no more than a single day, in case you need to revert the HTTPS infrastructure to HTTP. After you're confident in the sustainability of the HTTPS configuration, increase the HSTS `max-age` value (commonly, one year).

The following highlighted code:

[Code example (complete source file; reference: enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program2.cs?highlight=7-14)](../../_code/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program2.cs.md)

* Sets the preload parameter of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header. Preload isn't part of the [RFC 6797 HSTS specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6797). Web browsers support preload of HSTS sites on fresh install. For more information, see [https://hstspreload.org/](https://hstspreload.org/).
* Enables the `includeSubDomain` directive, which applies the HSTS policy to host subdomains. For more information, see [RFC 6797 HSTS specification (Section 6.1.2)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.2).
* Explicitly sets the `max-age` parameter of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to 60 days. If not set, it defaults to 30 days. For more information, see the `max-age` directive in [RFC 6797 HSTS specification (Section 6.1.1)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.1).
* Adds `example.com` to the list of hosts to exclude.

`UseHsts` excludes the following loopback hosts:

* `localhost`: The IPv4 loopback address.
* `127.0.0.1`: The IPv4 loopback address.
* `[::1]`: The IPv6 loopback address.

## Opt out of HTTPS/HSTS on project creation

In some back-end service scenarios where connection security is handled at the public-facing edge of the network, configuring connection security at each node isn't required. Web apps that are generated from the templates in Visual Studio or from the [dotnet new](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command enable [HTTPS redirection](#require-https) and [HSTS](#hsts). For deployments that don't require these scenarios, you can opt out of HTTPS/HSTS when the app is created from the template.

To opt out of HTTPS/HSTS:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio) 

When you create a new ASP.NET Core web app, unselect the **Configure for HTTPS** option:

Screenshot that shows the 'Create a new ASP.NET Core web application' dialog in Visual Studio, and 'Configure for HTTPS' unselected.

# [.NET CLI](#tab/net-cli) 

Use the `--no-https` option with the `dotnet new webapp` command, for example:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new webapp --no-https
```

---

<a name="trust"></a>

## Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate

The .NET SDK includes an HTTPS development certificate. The certificate is installed as part of the first-run experience. For example, the `dotnet --info` command produces a variation of the following output:

```cli
ASP.NET Core
------------
Successfully installed the ASP.NET Core HTTPS Development Certificate.
To trust the certificate run 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust' (Windows and macOS only).
For establishing trust on other platforms refer to the platform specific documentation.
For more information on configuring HTTPS see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848054.
```

Installing the .NET SDK installs the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate to the local user certificate store. The certificate is installed, but it isn't trusted. To trust the certificate, perform the one-time step to run the `dotnet dev-certs` tool:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

The following command provides help on the `dotnet dev-certs` tool:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --help
```

> **Warning:**
> Don't create a development certificate in an environment planned for redistribution, such as a container image or virtual machine. This scenario can lead to spoofing and elevation of privilege. To help prevent this situation, set the `DOTNET_GENERATE_ASPNET_CERTIFICATE` environment variable to `false` before calling the .NET CLI for the first time. This approach skips the automatic generation of the ASP.NET Core development certificate during the CLI's first-run experience.

## Set up developer certificate for Docker

To configure the developer certificate for Docker, see [GitHub dotnet/aspnetcore.docs issue #6199](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/6199) - _How to set up the dev certificate when using Docker in development_.

## Linux-specific considerations

Linux distributions differ substantially in how they mark certificates as trusted.

The `dotnet dev-certs` tool is expected to be broadly applicable, but official support is available for Ubuntu and Fedora only. The support specifically aims to ensure trust in Firefox and Chromium-based browsers (Microsoft Edge, Chrome, and Chromium).

### Dependencies

* To establish OpenSSL trust, the `openssl` tool must be on the path.
* To establish browser trust (for example in Microsoft Edge or Firefox), the `certutil` tool must be on the path.

### OpenSSL trust

When an ASP.NET Core development certificate is trusted, the certificate is exported to a folder in the current user's home directory. To have [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (and clients that consume it) pick up this folder, you need to set the `SSL_CERT_DIR` environment variable. You can set the variable in a single session by running a command like `export SSL_CERT_DIR=$HOME/.aspnet/dev-certs/trust:/usr/lib/ssl/certs` (the exact value is in the output when `--verbose` is passed) or by adding it your (distro- and shell-specific) configuration file (for example _.profile_).

This approach is required to make tools like `curl` trust the development certificate. Alternatively, you can pass `-CAfile` or `-CApath` to each individual `curl` invocation.

> **Note:**
> Requires 1.1.1h or later or 3.0.0 or later, depending on which major version you're using.

If OpenSSL trust gets into a bad state (for example if `dotnet dev-certs https --clean` fails to remove it), you can frequently resolve the situation by using the [c_rehash](https://docs.openssl.org/master/man1/openssl-rehash/) tool.

### Overrides

If you're using another browser with its own Network Security Services (NSS) store, you can use the `DOTNET_DEV_CERTS_NSSDB_PATHS` environment variable to specify a colon-delimited list of NSS directories (for example, the directory containing `cert9.db`). You can then add the development certificate location to the list in the variable.

If you store the certificates you want OpenSSL to trust in a specific directory, you can use the `DOTNET_DEV_CERTS_OPENSSL_CERTIFICATE_DIRECTORY` environment variable to indicate the certificate location.

> **Warning:**
> If you set either variable, be sure to set the same values each time trust is updated. If the values change, the tool doesn't know about certificates in the former locations (for example, during certificate cleanup).

### Using sudo

As on other platforms, development certificates are stored and trusted separately for each user. 

If you run `dotnet dev-certs` as a different user (for example, by using `sudo`), then _that_ specific user (for example `root`) trusts the development certificate.

### Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux with linux-dev-certs

[linux-dev-certs](https://github.com/tmds/linux-dev-certs) is an open-source, community-supported, .NET global tool that provides a convenient way to create and trust a developer certificate on Linux. Microsoft doesn't maintain or support the tool.

The following commands install the tool and create a trusted developer certificate:

```cli
dotnet tool update -g linux-dev-certs
dotnet linux-dev-certs install
```

For more information or to report issues, see the [linux-dev-certs GitHub repository](https://github.com/tmds/linux-dev-certs).

### Trust the certificate on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) and openSUSE

`dotnet dev-certs https --trust` isn't officially supported on SLES. Use the following steps to export the development certificate and trust it in Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and command-line tools. The steps were verified on SLES 15 SP7 and openSUSE Leap 15.6.

> **Warning:**
> The following instructions are intended for development purposes only. Don't use the development certificate in a production environment.

> **Note:**
> Adding the certificate to the system trust store (`/etc/pki/trust/anchors/` followed by `update-ca-certificates`) doesn't work for the development certificate. The certificate isn't a certificate authority (`CA:FALSE`), so `p11-kit` lists it as an anchor but doesn't include it in the generated bundles, and OpenSSL continues to reject it. Trust it per application as shown below instead.

#### Install dependencies

The `certutil` tool used to manage browser certificate stores is provided by the `mozilla-nss-tools` package:

```sh
sudo zypper install mozilla-nss-tools openssl
```

#### Export the development certificate

Replace `${CertificateDirectory}` with a directory outside your source repositories, for example `$HOME/.aspnet/https`:

```sh
mkdir -p ${CertificateDirectory}
dotnet dev-certs https -ep ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt --format PEM --no-password
```

#### Trust the certificate in Chromium-based browsers (Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Chromium)

```sh
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n aspnetcore -i ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt
```

If `$HOME/.pki/nssdb` doesn't exist yet, create it first with `certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -N --empty-password`. Restart the browser after importing.

#### Trust the certificate in Firefox

Replace `${UserProfile}` with the name of your Firefox profile directory (see `about:profiles` in Firefox):

```sh
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/${UserProfile}/ -A -t "C,," -n aspnetcore -i ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt
```

#### Trust the certificate in curl and other OpenSSL clients

Pass the exported certificate explicitly:

```sh
curl --cacert ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt https://localhost:5001
```

Alternatively, point `SSL_CERT_DIR` at a directory that contains the certificate as described in [OpenSSL trust](#openssl-trust).

#### Remove the development certificate

```sh
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -D -n aspnetcore
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/${UserProfile}/ -D -n aspnetcore
rm ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
```

### Trust the certificate on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

`dotnet dev-certs https --trust` isn't officially supported on RHEL. The following steps mirror the [SLES instructions](#trust-the-certificate-on-suse-linux-enterprise-server-sles-and-opensuse), adapted for RHEL package names.

> **Warning:**
> The following instructions are intended for development purposes only. Don't use the development certificate in a production environment.

> **Note:**
> As on SLES, adding the certificate to the system trust store (`/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/` followed by `update-ca-trust`) doesn't work for the development certificate. The certificate isn't a certificate authority (`CA:FALSE`), so trust it per application as shown below instead.

#### Install dependencies

The `certutil` tool used to manage browser certificate stores is provided by the `nss-tools` package:

```sh
sudo dnf install nss-tools openssl
```

#### Export the development certificate

Replace `${CertificateDirectory}` with a directory outside your source repositories, for example `$HOME/.aspnet/https`:

```sh
mkdir -p ${CertificateDirectory}
dotnet dev-certs https -ep ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt --format PEM --no-password
```

#### Trust the certificate in Chromium-based browsers (Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Chromium)

```sh
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n aspnetcore -i ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt
```

If `$HOME/.pki/nssdb` doesn't exist yet, create it first with `certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -N --empty-password`. Restart the browser after importing.

#### Trust the certificate in Firefox

Replace `${UserProfile}` with the name of your Firefox profile directory (see `about:profiles` in Firefox):

```sh
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/${UserProfile}/ -A -t "C,," -n aspnetcore -i ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt
```

#### Trust the certificate in curl and other OpenSSL clients

Pass the exported certificate explicitly:

```sh
curl --cacert ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt https://localhost:5001
```

Alternatively, create an OpenSSL hashed certificate directory and point `SSL_CERT_DIR` at it:

```sh
mkdir -p ${CertificateDirectory}/certs
cp ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt ${CertificateDirectory}/certs/
openssl rehash ${CertificateDirectory}/certs
export SSL_CERT_DIR=${CertificateDirectory}/certs
```

#### Remove the development certificate

```sh
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -D -n aspnetcore
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/${UserProfile}/ -D -n aspnetcore
rm ${CertificateDirectory}/aspnetcore.crt
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
```

## Troubleshoot certificate problems (certificate not trusted)

Sometimes when an ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate is [installed and trusted](#trust), the browser warns that the certificate is untrusted. The following sections provide help for troubleshooting this issue.

The ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate is used by [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md).

To repair the IIS Express certificate, see [Stack Overflow issue #20036984 / answer #20048613](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20036984/how-do-i-restore-a-missing-iis-express-ssl-certificate/20048613#20048613) - _How do I restore a missing IIS Express SSL Certificate?_

### All platforms - certificate not trusted

For all platforms, try to resolve the untrusted certificate issues with the following steps:

1. Run the following commands:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet dev-certs https --clean
   dotnet dev-certs https --trust
   ```

1. Close any open browser instances, and open the app in a new browser window.

   The browser cache stores whether a certificate is trusted. The close/open process helps to refresh the browser cache settings for certificates.

The `dotnet dev-certs https` commands usually solve most browser trust issues. If the `dotnet dev-certs https --clean` command fails and the browser still doesn't trust the certificate, try the platform-specific suggestions in the following sections.

### Docker - certificate not trusted

If you're using Docker, try to resolve the issue with the following steps:

1. Delete the _C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\ASP.NET\Https_ folder.

1. Clean the solution. Delete the _bin_ and _obj_ folders.

1. Restart the development tool. For example, Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

### Windows - certificate not trusted

If you're working in Windows, complete the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Check the certificates in the certificate store. Look for a `localhost` certificate with the `ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate` friendly name in two folders:

   * _Current User > Personal > Certificates_
   * _Current User > Trusted root certification authorities > Certificates_

1. Remove all certificates from both Personal and Trusted root certification authorities.

   > **Important:**
   > Do **not** remove the IIS Express localhost certificate.

1. Run the following commands:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet dev-certs https --clean
   dotnet dev-certs https --trust
   ```

1. Close any open browser instances, and open the app in a new browser window.

### OS X - certificate not trusted

If you're working with OS X, try to resolve the issue with the following steps:

1. Open KeyChain Access, and then select the System keychain.

1. Check for the presence of a localhost certificate.

1. Confirm the certificate shows the plus (`+`) symbol on the icon, which indicates the certificate is trusted for all users.

1. Remove the certificate from the system keychain.

1. Run the following commands:

   ```dotnetcli
   dotnet dev-certs https --clean
   dotnet dev-certs https --trust
   ```

1. Close any open browser instances, and open the app in a new browser window.

For more information about troubleshooting certificate issues with Visual Studio, see [GitHub dotnet/aspnetcore issue #16892)](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/issues/16892) - _HTTPS Error using IIS Express_.

### Linux - certificate not trusted

If you're running Linux, follow these steps to troubleshoot the untrusted certificate:

1. Confirm the certificate you're investigating is the user HTTPS developer certificate planned for use by the Kestrel server.

1. Check the current user default HTTPS developer Kestrel certificate at the following location:

   ```cmd
   ls -la ~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my
   ```

   The HTTPS developer Kestrel certificate file is the SHA1 thumbprint. When the file is deleted with the `dotnet dev-certs https --clean` command, the file is regenerated when needed with a different thumbprint.

1. Verify the thumbprint of the exported certificate matches by running the following command:

   ```cmd
   openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt
   ```

   If the certificate thumbprint doesn't match, investigate the following conditions:

   * Check if the certificate is old.

   * Check if the certificate is an exported developer certificate for the root user.

      * If it is, export the certificate.

1. Check the root user certificate in the following folder:

   ```cmd
   ls -la /root/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my
   ```

### IIS Express SSL certificate used with Visual Studio

To fix problems with the IIS Express certificate, select **Repair** in the Visual Studio installer. For more information, see [GitHub dotnet/aspnetcore issue #16892)](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/issues/16892) - _HTTPS Error using IIS Express_.

### Group policy prevents trusting self-signed certificates

In some cases, group policy can prevent self-signed certificates from being trusted. For more information, see [GitHub dotnet/aspnetcore issue #21173](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21173) - _Error trusting HTTPS developer certificate_.

### HTTP redirection to HTTPS causes ERR_INVALID_REDIRECT on the CORS preflight request

Requests to an endpoint using HTTP that are redirected to HTTPS by [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A) fail with `ERR_INVALID_REDIRECT` on the CORS preflight request.

API projects can reject HTTP requests rather than use `UseHttpsRedirection` to redirect requests to HTTPS.

## Require HTTPS

We recommend that production ASP.NET Core web apps use:

* HTTPS redirection middleware ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A)) to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
* HSTS middleware ([UseHsts](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol)) to send HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocol headers to clients.

> **Note:**
> Apps deployed in a reverse proxy configuration allow the proxy to handle connection security (HTTPS). If the proxy also handles HTTPS redirection, there's no need to use HTTPS redirection middleware. If the proxy server also handles writing HSTS headers (for example, [native HSTS support in IIS 10.0 (1709) or later](https://learn.microsoft.com/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-10-version-1709/iis-10-version-1709-hsts#iis-100-version-1709-native-hsts-support)), HSTS middleware isn't required by the app. For more information, see [Opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS on project creation](#opt-out-of-httpshsts-on-project-creation).

### HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`)

The following code calls [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A) in the `Program.cs` file:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program.cs?highlight=13](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

The preceding highlighted code:

* Uses the default [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode) ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect)).
* Uses the default [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort) (null) unless overridden by the `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature).

We recommend using temporary redirects rather than permanent redirects. Link caching can cause unstable behavior in development environments. If you prefer to send a permanent redirect status code when the app is in a non-`Development` environment, see the [Configure permanent redirects in production](#configure-permanent-redirects-in-production) section. We recommend using [HSTS](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol) to signal to clients that only secure resource requests should be sent to the app (only in production).

### Port configuration

A port must be available for the middleware to redirect an insecure request to HTTPS. If no port is available:

* Redirection to HTTPS doesn't occur.
* The middleware logs the warning "Failed to determine the https port for redirect."

Specify the HTTPS port using any of the following approaches:

* Set [HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort](#options).
* Set the `https_port` [host setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fhost%2Fgeneric-host%23https_port):

  * In host configuration.
  * By setting the `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable.
  * By adding a top-level entry in `appsettings.json`:

    [Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/appsettings.json?highlight=2](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

* Indicate a port with the secure scheme using the [ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fhost%2Fgeneric-host%23urls). The environment variable configures the server. The middleware indirectly discovers the HTTPS port via [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature). This approach doesn't work in reverse proxy deployments.
* The ASP.NET Core web templates set an HTTPS URL in `Properties/launchsettings.json` for both Kestrel and IIS Express. `launchsettings.json` is only used on the local machine.
* Configure an HTTPS URL endpoint for a public-facing edge deployment of [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) server or [HTTP.sys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md) server. Only **one HTTPS port** is used by the app. The middleware discovers the port via [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature).

> **Note:**
> When an app is run in a reverse proxy configuration, [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature) isn't available. Set the port using one of the other approaches described in this section.

### Edge deployments

When [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) or [HTTP.sys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md) is used as a public-facing edge server, Kestrel or HTTP.sys must be configured to listen on both:

* The secure port where the client is redirected (typically, 443 in production and 5001 in development).
* The insecure port (typically, 80 in production and 5000 in development).

The insecure port must be accessible by the client in order for the app to receive an insecure request and redirect the client to the secure port.

For more information, see [Kestrel endpoint configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fservers%2Fkestrel%23endpoint-configuration) or [fundamentals/servers/httpsys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md).

### Deployment scenarios

Any firewall between the client and server must also have communication ports open for traffic.

If requests are forwarded in a reverse proxy configuration, use [forwarded headers middleware](../host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer.md) before calling HTTPS redirection middleware. Forwarded headers middleware updates the `Request.Scheme`, using the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. The middleware permits redirect URIs and other security policies to work correctly. When forwarded headers middleware isn't used, the backend app might not receive the correct scheme and end up in a redirect loop. A common end user error message is that too many redirects have occurred.

When deploying to Azure App Service, follow the guidance in [Tutorial: Bind an existing custom SSL certificate to Azure Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-ssl).

### Options

The following highlighted code calls [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsRedirectionServicesExtensions.AddHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsRedirectionServicesExtensions.AddHttpsRedirection%252A) to configure middleware options:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program2.cs?highlight=16-20](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

Calling `AddHttpsRedirection` is only necessary to change the values of `HttpsPort` or `RedirectStatusCode`.

The preceding highlighted code:

* Sets [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode%252A) to [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect), which is the default value. Use the fields of the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes) class for assignments to `RedirectStatusCode`.
* Sets the HTTPS port to 5001.

#### Configure permanent redirects in production

The middleware defaults to sending a [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect) with all redirects. If you prefer to send a permanent redirect status code when the app is in a non-`Development` environment, wrap the middleware options configuration in a conditional check for a non-`Development` environment.

When configuring services in `Program.cs`:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program3.cs?highlight=7-14](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

## HTTPS redirection middleware alternative approach

An alternative to using HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`) is to use URL rewriting middleware (`AddRedirectToHttps`). `AddRedirectToHttps` can also set the status code and port when the redirect is executed. For more information, see [URL rewriting middleware](../fundamentals/url-rewriting.md).

When redirecting to HTTPS without the requirement for additional redirect rules, we recommend using HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`) described in this article.

## HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocol

Per [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project), [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) is an opt-in security enhancement that's specified by a web app through the use of a response header. When a [browser that supports HSTS](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.html#browser-support) receives this header:

* The browser stores configuration for the domain that prevents sending any communication over HTTP. The browser forces all communication over HTTPS.
* The browser prevents the user from using untrusted or invalid certificates. The browser disables prompts that allow a user to temporarily trust such a certificate.

Because [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) is enforced by the client, it has some limitations:

* The client must support HSTS.
* HSTS requires at least one successful HTTPS request to establish the HSTS policy.
* The application must check every HTTP request and redirect or reject the HTTP request.

ASP.NET Core implements HSTS with the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HstsBuilderExtensions.UseHsts%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HstsBuilderExtensions.UseHsts%252A) extension method. The following code calls `UseHsts` when the app isn't in [development mode](../fundamentals/environments.md):

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program.cs?highlight=10](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

`UseHsts` isn't recommended in development because the HSTS settings are highly cacheable by browsers. By default, `UseHsts` excludes the local loopback address.

For production environments that are implementing HTTPS for the first time, set the initial [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HstsOptions.MaxAge%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HstsOptions.MaxAge%252A) to a small value using one of the [System.TimeSpan](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.TimeSpan) methods. Set the value from hours to no more than a single day in case you need to revert the HTTPS infrastructure to HTTP. After you're confident in the sustainability of the HTTPS configuration, increase the HSTS `max-age` value; a commonly used value is one year.

The following highlighted code:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program2.cs?highlight=7-14](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

* Sets the preload parameter of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header. Preload isn't part of the [RFC HSTS specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797), but is supported by web browsers to preload HSTS sites on fresh install. For more information, see [https://hstspreload.org/](https://hstspreload.org/).
* Enables [includeSubDomain](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.2), which applies the HSTS policy to Host subdomains.
* Explicitly sets the `max-age` parameter of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to 60 days. If not set, defaults to 30 days. For more information, see the [max-age directive](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.1).
* Adds `example.com` to the list of hosts to exclude.

`UseHsts` excludes the following loopback hosts:

* `localhost` : The IPv4 loopback address.
* `127.0.0.1` : The IPv4 loopback address.
* `[::1]` : The IPv6 loopback address.

## Opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS on project creation

In some backend service scenarios where connection security is handled at the public-facing edge of the network, configuring connection security at each node isn't required. Web apps that are generated from the templates in Visual Studio or from the [dotnet new](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command enable [HTTPS redirection](#require-https) and [HSTS](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol). For deployments that don't require these scenarios, you can opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS when the app is created from the template.

To opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio) 

Uncheck the **Configure for HTTPS** checkbox.

New ASP.NET Core Web Application dialog showing the Configure for HTTPS checkbox unselected.

# [.NET CLI](#tab/net-cli) 

Use the `--no-https` option. For example

```dotnetcli
dotnet new webapp --no-https
```

## Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Windows and macOS

For the Firefox browser, see the next section.

The .NET Core SDK includes an HTTPS development certificate. The certificate is installed as part of the first-run experience. For example, `dotnet --info` produces a variation of the following output:

```cli
ASP.NET Core
------------
Successfully installed the ASP.NET Core HTTPS Development Certificate.
To trust the certificate run 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust' (Windows and macOS only).
For establishing trust on other platforms refer to the platform specific documentation.
For more information on configuring HTTPS see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848054.
```

Installing the .NET Core SDK installs the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate to the local user certificate store. The certificate has been installed, but it's not trusted. To trust the certificate, perform the one-time step to run the `dotnet dev-certs` tool:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

The following command provides help on the `dotnet dev-certs` tool:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --help
```

> **Warning:**
> Do not create a development certificate in an environment that will be redistributed, such as a container image or virtual machine. Doing so can lead to spoofing and elevation of privilege. To help prevent this, set the `DOTNET_GENERATE_ASPNET_CERTIFICATE` environment variable to `false` prior to calling the .NET CLI for the first time. This will skip the automatic generation of the ASP.NET Core development certificate during the CLI's first-run experience.

### Trust the HTTPS certificate with Firefox to prevent SEC_ERROR_INADEQUATE_KEY_USAGE error

The Firefox browser uses its own certificate store, and therefore doesn't trust the [IIS Express](https://learn.microsoft.com/iis/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview) or [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) developer certificates.

There are two approaches to trusting the HTTPS certificate with Firefox, create a policy file or configure with the FireFox browser. Configuring with the browser creates the policy file, so the two approaches are equivalent.

#### Create a policy file to trust HTTPS certificate with Firefox

Create a policy file (`policies.json`) at:

* Windows: `%PROGRAMFILES%\Mozilla Firefox\distribution\`
* MacOS: `Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/distribution`
* Linux: See [Trust the certificate with Firefox on Linux](#trust-ff-linux) in this article.

Add the following JSON to the Firefox policy file:

```json
{
  "policies": {
    "Certificates": {
      "ImportEnterpriseRoots": true
    }
  }
}
```

The preceding policy file makes Firefox trust certificates from the trusted certificates in the Windows certificate store. The next section provides an alternative approach to create the preceding policy file by using the Firefox browser.

<a name="trust-ff-ba"></a>

### Configure trust of HTTPS certificate using Firefox browser

Set  `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` = `true` using the following instructions:

1. Enter `about:config` in the FireFox browser.
1. Select **Accept the Risk and Continue** if you accept the risk.
1. Select **Show All**
1. Set `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` = `true`
1. Exit and restart Firefox

For more information, see [Setting Up Certificate Authorities (CAs) in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/setting-certificate-authorities-firefox) and the [mozilla/policy-templates/README file](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md).

## How to set up a developer certificate for Docker

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/6199).

## Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux

Establishing trust is distribution and browser specific. The following sections provide instructions for some popular distributions and the Chromium browsers (Edge and Chrome) and for Firefox.

<!-- Uncomment when linus-dev-certs supports .NET 6>
### Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux with linux-dev-certs

[linux-dev-certs](https://github.com/tmds/linux-dev-certs) is an open-source, community-supported, .NET global tool that provides a convenient way to create and trust a developer certificate on Linux. The tool is not maintained or supported by Microsoft.

The following commands install the tool and create a trusted developer certificate:

```cli
dotnet tool update -g linux-dev-certs
dotnet linux-dev-certs install
```

For more information or to report issues, see the [linux-dev-certs GitHub repository](https://github.com/tmds/linux-dev-certs).
-->

### Ubuntu trust the certificate for service-to-service communication

The following instructions don't work for some Ubuntu versions, such as 20.04. For more information, see GitHub issue [dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs #23686](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/23686).

1. Install [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) 1.1.1h or later. See your distribution for instructions on how to update OpenSSL.
1. Run the following commands:

    ```cli
    dotnet dev-certs https
    sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
    sudo update-ca-certificates
    ```

The preceding commands:

* Ensure the current user's developer certificate is created.
* Exports the certificate with elevated permissions needed for the `ca-certificates` folder, using the current user's environment.
* Removing the `-E`  flag exports the root user certificate, generating it if necessary. Each newly generated certificate has a different thumbprint. When running as root, `sudo`  and  `-E` are not needed.

The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

<a name="ssl-linux"></a>

### Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux using Edge or Chrome

# [Ubuntu](#tab/linux-ubuntu)

For chromium browsers on Linux:

* Install the `libnss3-tools` for your distribution.
* Create or verify the `$HOME/.pki/nssdb` folder exists on the machine.
* Export the certificate with the following command:

   ```cli
   dotnet dev-certs https
   sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
   ```

   The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

* Run the following commands:

   ```cli
   certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n localhost -i /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt
   ```

* Exit and restart the browser.

<a name="trust-ff-linux"></a>

#### Trust the certificate with Firefox on Linux

* Export the certificate with the following command:

  ```vstscli
  dotnet dev-certs https
  sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
  ```

  The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

* Create a JSON file at `/usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json` with the following command:

```sh
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json
{
    "policies": {
        "Certificates": {
            "Install": [
                "/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt"
            ]
        }
    }
}
EOF
```
Note: Ubuntu 21.10 Firefox comes as a snap package and the installation folder is `/snap/firefox/current/usr/lib/firefox`.
  
See [Configure trust of HTTPS certificate using Firefox browser](#trust-ff-ba) in this article for an alternative way to configure the policy file using the browser.

### Trust the certificate with Fedora 34

See:

* [This GitHub comment](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32361#issuecomment-837111639)
* [Fedora: Using Shared System Certificates](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/using-shared-system-certificates/)
* [Set up a .NET development environment](https://fedoramagazine.org/set-up-a-net-development-environment/) on Fedora.

### Trust the certificate with other distros

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32842).

## Trust HTTPS certificate from Windows Subsystem for Linux

The following instructions don't work for some Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu 20.04. For more information, see GitHub issue [dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs #23686](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/23686).

The [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about) generates an HTTPS self-signed development certificate, which by default isn't trusted in Windows. The easiest way to have Windows trust the WSL certificate, is to configure WSL to use the same certificate as Windows:

* On ***Windows***, export the developer certificate to a file:

  ```
  dotnet dev-certs https -ep https.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$ --trust
  ```
  Where `$CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$` is a password.

* In a WSL window, import the exported certificate on the WSL instance:

  ```
  dotnet dev-certs https --clean --import <<path-to-pfx>> --password $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$
  ```

The preceding approach is a one time operation per certificate and per WSL distribution. It's easier than exporting the certificate over and over. If you update or regenerate the certificate on windows, you might need to run the preceding commands again.

## Troubleshoot certificate problems such as certificate not trusted

This section provides help when the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate has been [installed and trusted](#trust), but you still have browser warnings that the certificate is not trusted. The ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate is used by [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md).

To repair the IIS Express certificate, see [this Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20048613/502537) issue.

### All platforms - certificate not trusted

Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances open. Open a new browser window to app. Certificate trust is cached by browsers.

### dotnet dev-certs https --clean Fails

The preceding commands solve most browser trust issues. If the browser is still not trusting the certificate, follow the platform-specific suggestions that follow.

### Docker - certificate not trusted

* Delete the *C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\ASP.NET\Https* folder.
* Clean the solution. Delete the *bin* and *obj* folders.
* Restart the development tool. For example, Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

### Windows - certificate not trusted

* Check the certificates in the certificate store. There should be a `localhost` certificate with the `ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate` friendly name both under `Current User > Personal > Certificates` and `Current User > Trusted root certification authorities > Certificates`
* Remove all the found certificates from both Personal and Trusted root certification authorities. Do **not** remove the IIS Express localhost certificate.
* Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances open. Open a new browser window to app.

### OS X - certificate not trusted

* Open KeyChain Access.
* Select the System keychain.
* Check for the presence of a localhost certificate.
* Check that it contains a `+` symbol on the icon to indicate it's trusted for all users.
* Remove the certificate from the system keychain.
* Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances open. Open a new browser window to app.

See [HTTPS Error using IIS Express (dotnet/AspNetCore #16892)](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/issues/16892) for troubleshooting certificate issues with Visual Studio.

### Linux certificate not trusted

Check that the certificate being configured for trust is the user HTTPS developer certificate that will be used by the Kestrel server.

Check the current user default HTTPS developer Kestrel certificate at the following location:

```
ls -la ~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my
```

The HTTPS developer Kestrel certificate file is the SHA1 thumbprint. When the file is deleted via `dotnet dev-certs https --clean`, it's regenerated when needed with a different thumbprint.
Check the thumbprint of the exported certificate matches with the following command:

```
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt
```

If the certificate doesn't match, it could be one of the following:

* An old certificate.
* An exported a developer certificate for the root user. For this case, export the  certificate.

The root user certificate can be checked at:

```
ls -la /root/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my
```

### IIS Express SSL certificate used with Visual Studio

To fix problems with the IIS Express certificate, select **Repair** from the Visual Studio installer. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/16892).

### Group policy prevents self-signed certificates from being trusted

In some cases, group policy may prevent self-signed certificates from being trusted. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21173).

**Applies to: < aspnetcore-6.0**

> **Warning:**
> ## API projects
>
> Do **not** use [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequireHttpsAttribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequireHttpsAttribute) on Web APIs that receive sensitive information. `RequireHttpsAttribute` uses HTTP status codes to redirect browsers from HTTP to HTTPS. API clients may not understand or obey redirects from HTTP to HTTPS. Such clients may send information over HTTP. Web APIs should either:
>
> * Not listen on HTTP.
> * Close the connection with status code 400 (Bad Request) and not serve the request.
>
> To disable HTTP redirection in an API, set the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable or use the `--urls` command line flag. For more information, see [fundamentals/environments](../fundamentals/environments.md) and [5 ways to set the URLs for an ASP.NET Core app](https://andrewlock.net/5-ways-to-set-the-urls-for-an-aspnetcore-app/) by Andrew Lock.
>
> ## HSTS and API projects
>
> The default API projects don't include [HSTS](#hsts) because HSTS is generally a browser only instruction. Other callers, such as phone or desktop apps, do **not** obey the instruction. Even within browsers, a single authenticated call to an API over HTTP has risks on insecure networks. The secure approach is to configure API projects to only listen to and respond over HTTPS.

## Require HTTPS

We recommend that production ASP.NET Core web apps use:

* HTTPS redirection middleware ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A)) to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
* HSTS middleware ([UseHsts](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol)) to send HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocol headers to clients.

> **Note:**
> Apps deployed in a reverse proxy configuration allow the proxy to handle connection security (HTTPS). If the proxy also handles HTTPS redirection, there's no need to use HTTPS redirection middleware. If the proxy server also handles writing HSTS headers (for example, [native HSTS support in IIS 10.0 (1709) or later](https://learn.microsoft.com/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-10-version-1709/iis-10-version-1709-hsts#iis-100-version-1709-native-hsts-support)), HSTS middleware isn't required by the app. For more information, see [Opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS on project creation](#opt-out-of-httpshsts-on-project-creation).

### UseHttpsRedirection

The following code calls `UseHttpsRedirection` in the `Startup` class:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/3.x/Startup.cs?name=snippet1\\&highlight=14](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

The preceding highlighted code:

* Uses the default [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode) ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect)).
* Uses the default [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort) (null) unless overridden by the `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature).

We recommend using temporary redirects rather than permanent redirects. Link caching can cause unstable behavior in development environments. If you prefer to send a permanent redirect status code when the app is in a non-`Development` environment, see the [Configure permanent redirects in production](#configure-permanent-redirects-in-production) section. We recommend using [HSTS](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol) to signal to clients that only secure resource requests should be sent to the app (only in production).

### Port configuration

A port must be available for the middleware to redirect an insecure request to HTTPS. If no port is available:

* Redirection to HTTPS doesn't occur.
* The middleware logs the warning "Failed to determine the https port for redirect."

Specify the HTTPS port using any of the following approaches:

* Set [HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort](#options).
* Set the `https_port` [host setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fhost%2Fgeneric-host%23https_port):

  * In host configuration.
  * By setting the `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable.
  * By adding a top-level entry in `appsettings.json`:

    [Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/3.x/appsettings.json?highlight=2](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

* Indicate a port with the secure scheme using the [ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fhost%2Fgeneric-host%23urls). The environment variable configures the server. The middleware indirectly discovers the HTTPS port via [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature). This approach doesn't work in reverse proxy deployments.
* In development, set an HTTPS URL in `launchsettings.json`. Enable HTTPS when IIS Express is used.

* Configure an HTTPS URL endpoint for a public-facing edge deployment of [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) server or [HTTP.sys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md) server. Only **one HTTPS port** is used by the app. The middleware discovers the port via [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature).

> **Note:**
> When an app is run in a reverse proxy configuration, [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature) isn't available. Set the port using one of the other approaches described in this section.

### Edge deployments 

When Kestrel or HTTP.sys is used as a public-facing edge server, Kestrel or HTTP.sys must be configured to listen on both:

* The secure port where the client is redirected (typically, 443 in production and 5001 in development).
* The insecure port (typically, 80 in production and 5000 in development).

The insecure port must be accessible by the client in order for the app to receive an insecure request and redirect the client to the secure port.

For more information, see [Kestrel endpoint configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fservers%2Fkestrel%23endpoint-configuration) or [fundamentals/servers/httpsys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md).

### Deployment scenarios

Any firewall between the client and server must also have communication ports open for traffic.

If requests are forwarded in a reverse proxy configuration, use [forwarded headers middleware](../host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer.md) before calling HTTPS redirection middleware. Forwarded headers middleware updates the `Request.Scheme`, using the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. The middleware permits redirect URIs and other security policies to work correctly. When forwarded headers middleware isn't used, the backend app might not receive the correct scheme and end up in a redirect loop. A common end user error message is that too many redirects have occurred.

When deploying to Azure App Service, follow the guidance in [Tutorial: Bind an existing custom SSL certificate to Azure Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-ssl).

### Options

The following highlighted code calls [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsRedirectionServicesExtensions.AddHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsRedirectionServicesExtensions.AddHttpsRedirection%252A) to configure middleware options:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/3.x/Startup.cs?name=snippet2\\&highlight=14-18](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

Calling `AddHttpsRedirection` is only necessary to change the values of `HttpsPort` or `RedirectStatusCode`.

The preceding highlighted code:

* Sets [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode%252A) to [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect), which is the default value. Use the fields of the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes) class for assignments to `RedirectStatusCode`.
* Sets the HTTPS port to 5001.

#### Configure permanent redirects in production

The middleware defaults to sending a [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect) with all redirects. If you prefer to send a permanent redirect status code when the app is in a non-`Development` environment, wrap the middleware options configuration in a conditional check for a non-`Development` environment.

When configuring services in `Startup.cs`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // IWebHostEnvironment (stored in _env) is injected into the Startup class.
    if (!_env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        services.AddHttpsRedirection(options =>
        {
            options.RedirectStatusCode = (int) HttpStatusCode.PermanentRedirect;
            options.HttpsPort = 443;
        });
    }
}
```

## HTTPS redirection middleware alternative approach

An alternative to using HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`) is to use URL rewriting middleware (`AddRedirectToHttps`). `AddRedirectToHttps` can also set the status code and port when the redirect is executed. For more information, see [URL rewriting middleware](../fundamentals/url-rewriting.md).

When redirecting to HTTPS without the requirement for additional redirect rules, we recommend using HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`) described in this article.

<a name="hsts"></a>

## HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocol

Per [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project), [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) is an opt-in security enhancement that's specified by a web app through the use of a response header. When a [browser that supports HSTS](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.html#browser-support) receives this header:

* The browser stores configuration for the domain that prevents sending any communication over HTTP. The browser forces all communication over HTTPS.
* The browser prevents the user from using untrusted or invalid certificates. The browser disables prompts that allow a user to temporarily trust such a certificate.

Because HSTS is enforced by the client, it has some limitations:

* The client must support HSTS.
* HSTS requires at least one successful HTTPS request to establish the HSTS policy.
* The application must check every HTTP request and redirect or reject the HTTP request.

ASP.NET Core implements HSTS with the `UseHsts` extension method. The following code calls `UseHsts` when the app isn't in [development mode](../fundamentals/environments.md):

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/3.x/Startup.cs?name=snippet1\\&highlight=11](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

`UseHsts` isn't recommended in development because the HSTS settings are highly cacheable by browsers. By default, `UseHsts` excludes the local loopback address.

For production environments that are implementing HTTPS for the first time, set the initial [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HstsOptions.MaxAge%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HstsOptions.MaxAge%252A) to a small value using one of the [System.TimeSpan](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.TimeSpan) methods. Set the value from hours to no more than a single day in case you need to revert the HTTPS infrastructure to HTTP. After you're confident in the sustainability of the HTTPS configuration, increase the HSTS `max-age` value; a commonly used value is one year.

The following code:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/3.x/Startup.cs?name=snippet2\\&highlight=5-12](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

* Sets the preload parameter of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header. Preload isn't part of the [RFC HSTS specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797), but is supported by web browsers to preload HSTS sites on fresh install. For more information, see [https://hstspreload.org/](https://hstspreload.org/).
* Enables [includeSubDomain](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.2), which applies the HSTS policy to Host subdomains.
* Explicitly sets the `max-age` parameter of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to 60 days. If not set, defaults to 30 days. For more information, see the [max-age directive](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.1).
* Adds `example.com` to the list of hosts to exclude.

`UseHsts` excludes the following loopback hosts:

* `localhost` : The IPv4 loopback address.
* `127.0.0.1` : The IPv4 loopback address.
* `[::1]` : The IPv6 loopback address.

## Opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS on project creation

In some backend service scenarios where connection security is handled at the public-facing edge of the network, configuring connection security at each node isn't required. Web apps that are generated from the templates in Visual Studio or from the [dotnet new](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command enable [HTTPS redirection](#require-https) and [HSTS](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol). For deployments that don't require these scenarios, you can opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS when the app is created from the template.

To opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio) 

Uncheck the **Configure for HTTPS** checkbox.

Additional information dialog for New ASP.NET Core Web App template, showing the Configure for HTTPS checkbox

# [.NET CLI](#tab/net-cli) 

Use the `--no-https` option. For example

```dotnetcli
dotnet new webapp --no-https
```

## Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Windows and macOS

For the Firefox browser, see the next section.

The .NET Core SDK includes an HTTPS development certificate. The certificate is installed as part of the first-run experience. For example, running `dotnet new webapp` for the first time produces a variation of the following output:

```output
Installed an ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate.
To trust the certificate, run 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust'
Learn about HTTPS: https://aka.ms/dotnet-https
```

Installing the .NET Core SDK installs the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate to the local user certificate store. The certificate has been installed, but it's not trusted. To trust the certificate, perform the one-time step to run the `dotnet dev-certs` tool:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

The following command provides help on the `dotnet dev-certs` tool:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --help
```

> **Warning:**
> Do not create a development certificate in an environment that will be redistributed, such as a container image or virtual machine. Doing so can lead to spoofing and elevation of privilege. To help prevent this, set the `DOTNET_GENERATE_ASPNET_CERTIFICATE` environment variable to `false` prior to calling the .NET CLI for the first time. This will skip the automatic generation of the ASP.NET Core development certificate during the CLI's first-run experience.

<a name="trust-ff"></a>

### Trust the HTTPS certificate with Firefox to prevent SEC_ERROR_INADEQUATE_KEY_USAGE error

The Firefox browser uses its own certificate store, and therefore doesn't trust the [IIS Express](https://learn.microsoft.com/iis/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview) or [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) developer certificates.

There are two approaches to trusting the HTTPS certificate with Firefox, create a policy file or configure with the FireFox browser. Configuring with the browser creates the policy file, so the two approaches are equivalent.

#### Create a policy file to trust HTTPS certificate with Firefox

Create a policy file (`policies.json`) at:

* Windows: `%PROGRAMFILES%\Mozilla Firefox\distribution\`
* MacOS: `Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/distribution`
* Linux: See [Trust the certificate with Firefox on Linux](#trust-ff-linux) later in this article.

Add the following JSON to the Firefox policy file:

```json
{
  "policies": {
    "Certificates": {
      "ImportEnterpriseRoots": true
    }
  }
}
```

The preceding policy file makes Firefox trust certificates from the trusted certificates in the Windows certificate store. The next section provides an alternative approach to create the preceding policy file by using the Firefox browser.

<a name="trust-ff-ba"></a>

### Configure trust of HTTPS certificate using Firefox browser

Set  `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` = `true` using the following instructions:

1. Enter `about:config` in the FireFox browser.
1. Select **Accept the Risk and Continue** if you accept the risk.
1. Select **Show All**.
1. Set `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` = `true`.
1. Exit and restart Firefox.

## How to set up a developer certificate for Docker

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/6199).

## Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux

Establishing trust is distribution and browser specific. The following sections provide instructions for some popular distributions and the Chromium browsers (Edge and Chrome) and for Firefox.

### Ubuntu trust the certificate for service-to-service communication

1. Install [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) 1.1.1h or later. See your distribution for instructions on how to update OpenSSL.
1. Run the following commands:

    ```cli
    dotnet dev-certs https
    sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
    sudo update-ca-certificates
    ```

The preceding commands:

* Ensure the current user's developer certificate is created.
* Export the certificate with elevated permissions needed for the `ca-certificates` folder, using the current user's environment.
* Remove the `-E`  flag to export the root user certificate, generating it if necessary. Each newly generated certificate has a different thumbprint. When running as root, `sudo`  and  `-E` are not needed.


The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

<a name="ssl-linux"></a>

### Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux using Edge or Chrome

For chromium browsers on Linux:

* Install the `libnss3-tools` for your distribution.
* Create or verify the `$HOME/.pki/nssdb` folder exists on the machine.
* Export the certificate with the following command:
  
   ```cli
   dotnet dev-certs https
   sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
   ```

   The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

* Run the following commands:
  
   ```cli
   certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n localhost -i /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt
   ```

* Exit and restart the browser.

<a name="trust-ff-linux"></a>

### Trust the certificate with Firefox on Linux

* Export the certificate with the following command:

  ```vstscli
  dotnet dev-certs https
  sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
  ```

  The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

* Create a JSON file at `/usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json` with the following contents:

```sh
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json
{
    "policies": {
        "Certificates": {
            "Install": [
                "/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt"
            ]
        }
    }
}
EOF
```
  
See [Configure trust of HTTPS certificate using Firefox browser](#trust-ff-ba) in this article for an alternative way to configure the policy file using the browser.

<a name="wsl"></a>

### Trust the certificate with Fedora 34

#### Firefox on Fedora

```bash
echo 'pref("general.config.filename", "firefox.cfg");
pref("general.config.obscure_value", 0);' > ./autoconfig.js

echo '//Enable policies.json
lockPref("browser.policies.perUserDir", false);' > firefox.cfg

echo "{
    \"policies\": {
        \"Certificates\": {
            \"Install\": [
                \"aspnetcore-localhost-https.crt\"
            ]
        }
    }
}" > policies.json

dotnet dev-certs https -ep localhost.crt --format PEM

sudo mv autoconfig.js /usr/lib64/firefox/
sudo mv firefox.cfg /usr/lib64/firefox/
sudo mv policies.json /usr/lib64/firefox/distribution/
mkdir -p ~/.mozilla/certificates
cp localhost.crt ~/.mozilla/certificates/aspnetcore-localhost-https.crt
rm localhost.crt
```

#### Trust dotnet-to-dotnet on Fedora

```bash
sudo cp localhost.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.pem
sudo update-ca-trust
rm localhost.crt
```

See [this GitHub comment](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32361#issuecomment-837111639) for more information.

### Trust the certificate with other distros

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32842).


## Trust HTTPS certificate from Windows Subsystem for Linux

The [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about) generates an HTTPS self-signed development certificate. To configure the Windows certificate store to trust the WSL certificate:

* Export the developer certificate to a file on ***Windows***:

  ```
  dotnet dev-certs https -ep C:\<<path-to-folder>>\aspnetcore.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$
  ```
  Where `$CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$` is a password.

* In a WSL window, import the exported certificate on the WSL instance:

  ```
  dotnet dev-certs https --clean --import /mnt/c/<<path-to-folder>>/aspnetcore.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$
  ```

The preceding approach is a one time operation per certificate and per WSL distribution. It's easier than exporting the certificate over and over. If you update or regenerate the certificate on windows, you might need to run the preceding commands again.

## Troubleshoot certificate problems such as certificate not trusted

This section provides help when the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate has been [installed and trusted](#trust), but you still have browser warnings that the certificate is not trusted. The ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate is used by [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md).

To repair the IIS Express certificate, see [this Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20048613/502537) issue.

### All platforms - certificate not trusted

Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances that are open. Open a new browser window to the app. Certificate trust is cached by browsers.

### dotnet dev-certs https --clean fails

The preceding commands solve most browser trust issues. If the browser is still not trusting the certificate, follow the platform-specific suggestions that follow.

### Docker - certificate not trusted

* Delete the *C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\ASP.NET\Https* folder.
* Clean the solution. Delete the *bin* and *obj* folders.
* Restart the development tool. For example, Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or Visual Studio for Mac.

### Windows - certificate not trusted

* Check the certificates in the certificate store. There should be a `localhost` certificate with the `ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate` friendly name both under `Current User > Personal > Certificates` and `Current User > Trusted root certification authorities > Certificates`
* Remove all the found certificates from both Personal and Trusted root certification authorities. Do **not** remove the IIS Express localhost certificate.
* Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances that are open. Open a new browser window to the app. Certificate trust is cached by browsers.

### OS X - certificate not trusted

* Open KeyChain Access.
* Select the System keychain.
* Check for the presence of a localhost certificate.
* Check that it contains a `+` symbol on the icon to indicate it's trusted for all users.
* Remove the certificate from the system keychain.
* Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances that are open. Open a new browser window to the app. Certificate trust is cached by browsers.

See [HTTPS Error using IIS Express (dotnet/AspNetCore #16892)](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/issues/16892) for troubleshooting certificate issues with Visual Studio.

### Linux certificate not trusted

Check that the certificate being configured for trust is the user HTTPS developer certificate that will be used by the Kestrel server.

Check the current user default HTTPS developer Kestrel certificate at the following location:

```
ls -la ~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my
```

The HTTPS developer Kestrel certificate file is the SHA1 thumbprint. When the file is deleted via `dotnet dev-certs https --clean`, it's regenerated when needed with a different thumbprint.
Check the thumbprint of the exported certificate matches with the following command:

```
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt
```

If the certificate doesn't match, it could be one of the following:

* An old certificate.
* An exported a developer certificate for the root user. For this case, export the  certificate.

The root user certificate can be checked at:

```
ls -la /root/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my
```

### IIS Express SSL certificate used with Visual Studio

To fix problems with the IIS Express certificate, select **Repair** from the Visual Studio installer. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/16892).

> **Warning:**
> ## API projects
>
> Do **not** use [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequireHttpsAttribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequireHttpsAttribute) on Web APIs that receive sensitive information. `RequireHttpsAttribute` uses HTTP status codes to redirect browsers from HTTP to HTTPS. API clients may not understand or obey redirects from HTTP to HTTPS. Such clients may send information over HTTP. Web APIs should either:
>
> * Not listen on HTTP.
> * Close the connection with status code 400 (Bad Request) and not serve the request.
>
> To disable HTTP redirection in an API, set the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable or use the `--urls` command line flag. For more information, see [fundamentals/environments](../fundamentals/environments.md) and [8 ways to set the URLs for an ASP.NET Core app](https://andrewlock.net/8-ways-to-set-the-urls-for-an-aspnetcore-app/) by Andrew Lock.

> ## HSTS and API projects
>
> The default API projects don't include [HSTS](#hsts) because [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) is generally a browser only instruction. Other callers, such as phone or desktop apps, do **not** obey the instruction. Even within browsers, a single authenticated call to an API over HTTP has risks on insecure networks. The secure approach is to configure API projects to only listen to and respond over HTTPS.

### HTTP redirection to HTTPS causes ERR_INVALID_REDIRECT on the CORS preflight request

Requests to an endpoint using HTTP that are redirected to HTTPS by [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A) fail with `ERR_INVALID_REDIRECT` on the CORS preflight request.

API projects can reject HTTP requests rather than use `UseHttpsRedirection` to redirect requests to HTTPS.

## Require HTTPS

We recommend that production ASP.NET Core web apps use:

* HTTPS redirection middleware ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A)) to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
* HSTS middleware ([UseHsts](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol)) to send HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocol headers to clients.

> **Note:**
> Apps deployed in a reverse proxy configuration allow the proxy to handle connection security (HTTPS). If the proxy also handles HTTPS redirection, there's no need to use HTTPS redirection middleware. If the proxy server also handles writing HSTS headers (for example, [native HSTS support in IIS 10.0 (1709) or later](https://learn.microsoft.com/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-10-version-1709/iis-10-version-1709-hsts#iis-100-version-1709-native-hsts-support)), HSTS middleware isn't required by the app. For more information, see [Opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS on project creation](#opt-out-of-httpshsts-on-project-creation).

### HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`)

The following code calls [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A) in the `Program.cs` file:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program.cs?highlight=13](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

The preceding highlighted code:

* Uses the default [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode) ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect)).
* Uses the default [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort) (null) unless overridden by the `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature).

We recommend using temporary redirects rather than permanent redirects. Link caching can cause unstable behavior in development environments. If you prefer to send a permanent redirect status code when the app is in a non-`Development` environment, see the [Configure permanent redirects in production](#configure-permanent-redirects-in-production) section. We recommend using [HSTS](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol) to signal to clients that only secure resource requests should be sent to the app (only in production).

### Port configuration

A port must be available for the middleware to redirect an insecure request to HTTPS. If no port is available:

* Redirection to HTTPS doesn't occur.
* The middleware logs the warning "Failed to determine the https port for redirect."

Specify the HTTPS port using any of the following approaches:

* Set [HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort](#options).
* Set the `https_port` [host setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fhost%2Fgeneric-host%23https_port):

  * In host configuration.
  * By setting the `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable.
  * By adding a top-level entry in `appsettings.json`:

    [Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/appsettings.json?highlight=2](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

* Indicate a port with the secure scheme using the [ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fhost%2Fgeneric-host%23urls). The environment variable configures the server. The middleware indirectly discovers the HTTPS port via [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature). This approach doesn't work in reverse proxy deployments.
* The ASP.NET Core web templates set an HTTPS URL in `Properties/launchsettings.json` for both Kestrel and IIS Express. `launchsettings.json` is only used on the local machine.
* Configure an HTTPS URL endpoint for a public-facing edge deployment of [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) server or [HTTP.sys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md) server. Only **one HTTPS port** is used by the app. The middleware discovers the port via [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature).

> **Note:**
> When an app is run in a reverse proxy configuration, [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature) isn't available. Set the port using one of the other approaches described in this section.

### Edge deployments

When [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) or [HTTP.sys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md) is used as a public-facing edge server, Kestrel or HTTP.sys must be configured to listen on both:

* The secure port where the client is redirected (typically, 443 in production and 5001 in development).
* The insecure port (typically, 80 in production and 5000 in development).

The insecure port must be accessible by the client in order for the app to receive an insecure request and redirect the client to the secure port.

For more information, see [Kestrel endpoint configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fservers%2Fkestrel%23endpoint-configuration) or [fundamentals/servers/httpsys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md).

### Deployment scenarios

Any firewall between the client and server must also have communication ports open for traffic.

If requests are forwarded in a reverse proxy configuration, use [forwarded headers middleware](../host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer.md) before calling HTTPS redirection middleware. Forwarded headers middleware updates the `Request.Scheme`, using the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. The middleware permits redirect URIs and other security policies to work correctly. When forwarded headers middleware isn't used, the backend app might not receive the correct scheme and end up in a redirect loop. A common end user error message is that too many redirects have occurred.

When deploying to Azure App Service, follow the guidance in [Tutorial: Bind an existing custom SSL certificate to Azure Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-ssl).

### Options

The following highlighted code calls [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsRedirectionServicesExtensions.AddHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsRedirectionServicesExtensions.AddHttpsRedirection%252A) to configure middleware options:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program2.cs?highlight=16-20](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

Calling `AddHttpsRedirection` is only necessary to change the values of `HttpsPort` or `RedirectStatusCode`.

The preceding highlighted code:

* Sets [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode%252A) to [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect), which is the default value. Use the fields of the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes) class for assignments to `RedirectStatusCode`.
* Sets the HTTPS port to 5001.

#### Configure permanent redirects in production

The middleware defaults to sending a [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect) with all redirects. If you prefer to send a permanent redirect status code when the app is in a non-`Development` environment, wrap the middleware options configuration in a conditional check for a non-`Development` environment.

When configuring services in `Program.cs`:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program3.cs?highlight=7-14](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

## HTTPS redirection middleware alternative approach

An alternative to using HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`) is to use URL rewriting middleware (`AddRedirectToHttps`). `AddRedirectToHttps` can also set the status code and port when the redirect is executed. For more information, see [URL rewriting middleware](../fundamentals/url-rewriting.md).

When redirecting to HTTPS without the requirement for additional redirect rules, we recommend using HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`) described in this article.

<a name="hsts"></a>

## HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocol

Per [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project), [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) is an opt-in security enhancement that's specified by a web app through the use of a response header. When a [browser that supports HSTS](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.html#browser-support) receives this header:

* The browser stores configuration for the domain that prevents sending any communication over HTTP. The browser forces all communication over HTTPS.
* The browser prevents the user from using untrusted or invalid certificates. The browser disables prompts that allow a user to temporarily trust such a certificate.

Because [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) is enforced by the client, it has some limitations:

* The client must support HSTS.
* HSTS requires at least one successful HTTPS request to establish the HSTS policy.
* The application must check every HTTP request and redirect or reject the HTTP request.

ASP.NET Core implements HSTS with the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HstsBuilderExtensions.UseHsts%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HstsBuilderExtensions.UseHsts%252A) extension method. The following code calls `UseHsts` when the app isn't in [development mode](../fundamentals/environments.md):

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program.cs?highlight=10](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

`UseHsts` isn't recommended in development because the HSTS settings are highly cacheable by browsers. By default, `UseHsts` excludes the local loopback address.

For production environments that are implementing HTTPS for the first time, set the initial [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HstsOptions.MaxAge%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HstsOptions.MaxAge%252A) to a small value using one of the [System.TimeSpan](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.TimeSpan) methods. Set the value from hours to no more than a single day in case you need to revert the HTTPS infrastructure to HTTP. After you're confident in the sustainability of the HTTPS configuration, increase the HSTS `max-age` value; a commonly used value is one year.

The following highlighted code:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program2.cs?highlight=7-14](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

* Sets the preload parameter of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header. Preload isn't part of the [RFC HSTS specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797), but is supported by web browsers to preload HSTS sites on fresh install. For more information, see [https://hstspreload.org/](https://hstspreload.org/).
* Enables [includeSubDomain](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.2), which applies the HSTS policy to Host subdomains.
* Explicitly sets the `max-age` parameter of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to 60 days. If not set, defaults to 30 days. For more information, see the [max-age directive](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.1).
* Adds `example.com` to the list of hosts to exclude.

`UseHsts` excludes the following loopback hosts:

* `localhost` : The IPv4 loopback address.
* `127.0.0.1` : The IPv4 loopback address.
* `[::1]` : The IPv6 loopback address.

## Opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS on project creation

In some backend service scenarios where connection security is handled at the public-facing edge of the network, configuring connection security at each node isn't required. Web apps that are generated from the templates in Visual Studio or from the [dotnet new](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command enable [HTTPS redirection](#require-https) and [HSTS](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol). For deployments that don't require these scenarios, you can opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS when the app is created from the template.

To opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio) 

Uncheck the **Configure for HTTPS** checkbox.

New ASP.NET Core Web Application dialog showing the Configure for HTTPS checkbox unselected.

# [.NET CLI](#tab/net-cli) 

Use the `--no-https` option. For example

```dotnetcli
dotnet new webapp --no-https
```

## Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Windows and macOS

For the Firefox browser, see the next section.

The .NET Core SDK includes an HTTPS development certificate. The certificate is installed as part of the first-run experience. For example, `dotnet --info` produces a variation of the following output:

```cli
ASP.NET Core
------------
Successfully installed the ASP.NET Core HTTPS Development Certificate.
To trust the certificate run 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust' (Windows and macOS only).
For establishing trust on other platforms refer to the platform specific documentation.
For more information on configuring HTTPS see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848054.
```

Installing the .NET Core SDK installs the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate to the local user certificate store. The certificate has been installed, but it's not trusted. To trust the certificate, perform the one-time step to run the `dotnet dev-certs` tool:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

The following command provides help on the `dotnet dev-certs` tool:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --help
```

> **Warning:**
> Do not create a development certificate in an environment that will be redistributed, such as a container image or virtual machine. Doing so can lead to spoofing and elevation of privilege. To help prevent this, set the `DOTNET_GENERATE_ASPNET_CERTIFICATE` environment variable to `false` prior to calling the .NET CLI for the first time. This will skip the automatic generation of the ASP.NET Core development certificate during the CLI's first-run experience.

<a name="trust-ff"></a>

### Trust the HTTPS certificate with Firefox to prevent SEC_ERROR_INADEQUATE_KEY_USAGE error

The Firefox browser uses its own certificate store, and therefore doesn't trust the [IIS Express](https://learn.microsoft.com/iis/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview) or [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) developer certificates.

There are two approaches to trusting the HTTPS certificate with Firefox, create a policy file or configure with the FireFox browser. Configuring with the browser creates the policy file, so the two approaches are equivalent.

#### Create a policy file to trust HTTPS certificate with Firefox

Create a policy file (`policies.json`) at:

* Windows: `%PROGRAMFILES%\Mozilla Firefox\distribution\`
* MacOS: `Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/distribution`
* Linux: See [Trust the certificate with Firefox on Linux](#trust-ff-linux) in this article.

Add the following JSON to the Firefox policy file:

```json
{
  "policies": {
    "Certificates": {
      "ImportEnterpriseRoots": true
    }
  }

### Configure trust of HTTPS certificate using Firefox browser

Set  `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` = `true` using the following instructions:

1. Enter `about:config` in the FireFox browser.
1. Select **Accept the Risk and Continue** if you accept the risk.
1. Select **Show All**
1. Set `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` = `true`
1. Exit and restart Firefox

For more information, see [Setting Up Certificate Authorities (CAs) in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/setting-certificate-authorities-firefox) and the [mozilla/policy-templates/README file](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md).

## How to set up a developer certificate for Docker

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/6199).

## Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux

Establishing trust is distribution and browser specific. The following sections provide instructions for some popular distributions and the Chromium browsers (Edge and Chrome) and for Firefox.

<!-- Uncomment when linus-dev-certs supports .NET 7>
### Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux with linux-dev-certs

[linux-dev-certs](https://github.com/tmds/linux-dev-certs) is an open-source, community-supported, .NET global tool that provides a convenient way to create and trust a developer certificate on Linux. The tool is not maintained or supported by Microsoft.

The following commands install the tool and create a trusted developer certificate:

```cli
dotnet tool update -g linux-dev-certs
dotnet linux-dev-certs install
```

For more information or to report issues, see the [linux-dev-certs GitHub repository](https://github.com/tmds/linux-dev-certs).
-->

### Ubuntu trust the certificate for service-to-service communication

The following instructions don't work for some Ubuntu versions, such as 20.04. For more information, see GitHub issue [dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs #23686](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/23686).

1. Install [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) 1.1.1h or later. See your distribution for instructions on how to update OpenSSL.
1. Run the following commands:

    ```cli
    dotnet dev-certs https
    sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
    sudo update-ca-certificates
    ```

The preceding commands:

* Ensure the current user's developer certificate is created.
* Exports the certificate with elevated permissions needed for the `ca-certificates` folder, using the current user's environment.
* Removing the `-E`  flag exports the root user certificate, generating it if necessary. Each newly generated certificate has a different thumbprint. When running as root, `sudo`  and  `-E` are not needed.

The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

<a name="ssl-linux"></a>

### Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux using Edge or Chrome

# [Ubuntu](#tab/linux-ubuntu)

For chromium browsers on Linux:

* Install the `libnss3-tools` for your distribution.
* Create or verify the `$HOME/.pki/nssdb` folder exists on the machine.
* Export the certificate with the following command:

   ```cli
   dotnet dev-certs https
   sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
   ```

   The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

* Run the following commands:

   ```cli
   certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n localhost -i /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt
   ```

* Exit and restart the browser.

<a name="trust-ff-linux"></a>

#### Trust the certificate with Firefox on Linux

* Export the certificate with the following command:

  ```vstscli
  dotnet dev-certs https
  sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
  ```

  The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

* Create a JSON file at `/usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json` with the following command:

```sh
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json
{
    "policies": {
        "Certificates": {
            "Install": [
                "/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt"
            ]
        }
    }
}
EOF
```
Note: Ubuntu 21.10 Firefox comes as a snap package and the installation folder is `/snap/firefox/current/usr/lib/firefox`.
  
See [Configure trust of HTTPS certificate using Firefox browser](#trust-ff-ba) in this article for an alternative way to configure the policy file using the browser.

### Trust the certificate with Fedora 34

See:

* [This GitHub comment](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32361#issuecomment-837111639)
* [Fedora: Using Shared System Certificates](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/using-shared-system-certificates/)
* [Set up a .NET development environment](https://fedoramagazine.org/set-up-a-net-development-environment/) on Fedora.

### Trust the certificate with other distros

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32842).

## Trust HTTPS certificate from Windows Subsystem for Linux

The following instructions don't work for some Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu 20.04. For more information, see GitHub issue [dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs #23686](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/23686).

The [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about) generates an HTTPS self-signed development certificate, which by default isn't trusted in Windows. The easiest way to have Windows trust the WSL certificate, is to configure WSL to use the same certificate as Windows:

* On ***Windows***, export the developer certificate to a file:

  ```
  dotnet dev-certs https -ep https.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$ --trust
  ```
  Where `$CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$` is a password.

* In a WSL window, import the exported certificate on the WSL instance:

  ```
  dotnet dev-certs https --clean --import <<path-to-pfx>> --password $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$
  ```

The preceding approach is a one time operation per certificate and per WSL distribution. It's easier than exporting the certificate over and over. If you update or regenerate the certificate on windows, you might need to run the preceding commands again.

<a name="tcp"></a>

## Troubleshoot certificate problems such as certificate not trusted

This section provides help when the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate has been [installed and trusted](#trust), but you still have browser warnings that the certificate is not trusted. The ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate is used by [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md).

To repair the IIS Express certificate, see [this Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20048613/502537) issue.

### All platforms - certificate not trusted

Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances open. Open a new browser window to app. Certificate trust is cached by browsers.

### dotnet dev-certs https --clean Fails

The preceding commands solve most browser trust issues. If the browser is still not trusting the certificate, follow the platform-specific suggestions that follow.

### Docker - certificate not trusted

* Delete the *C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\ASP.NET\Https* folder.
* Clean the solution. Delete the *bin* and *obj* folders.
* Restart the development tool. For example, Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

### Windows - certificate not trusted

* Check the certificates in the certificate store. There should be a `localhost` certificate with the `ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate` friendly name both under `Current User > Personal > Certificates` and `Current User > Trusted root certification authorities > Certificates`
* Remove all the found certificates from both Personal and Trusted root certification authorities. Do **not** remove the IIS Express localhost certificate.
* Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances open. Open a new browser window to app.

### OS X - certificate not trusted

* Open KeyChain Access.
* Select the System keychain.
* Check for the presence of a localhost certificate.
* Check that it contains a `+` symbol on the icon to indicate it's trusted for all users.
* Remove the certificate from the system keychain.
* Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances open. Open a new browser window to app.

See [HTTPS Error using IIS Express (dotnet/AspNetCore #16892)](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/issues/16892) for troubleshooting certificate issues with Visual Studio.

### Linux certificate not trusted

Check that the certificate being configured for trust is the user HTTPS developer certificate that will be used by the Kestrel server.

Check the current user default HTTPS developer Kestrel certificate at the following location:

```
ls -la ~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my
```

The HTTPS developer Kestrel certificate file is the SHA1 thumbprint. When the file is deleted via `dotnet dev-certs https --clean`, it's regenerated when needed with a different thumbprint.
Check the thumbprint of the exported certificate matches with the following command:

```
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt
```

If the certificate doesn't match, it could be one of the following:

* An old certificate.
* An exported a developer certificate for the root user. For this case, export the  certificate.

The root user certificate can be checked at:

```
ls -la /root/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my
```

### IIS Express SSL certificate used with Visual Studio

To fix problems with the IIS Express certificate, select **Repair** from the Visual Studio installer. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/16892).

### Group policy prevents self-signed certificates from being trusted

In some cases, group policy may prevent self-signed certificates from being trusted. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21173).

>
> Do **not** use [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequireHttpsAttribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RequireHttpsAttribute) on Web APIs that receive sensitive information. `RequireHttpsAttribute` uses HTTP status codes to redirect browsers from HTTP to HTTPS. API clients may not understand or obey redirects from HTTP to HTTPS. Such clients may send information over HTTP. Web APIs should either:
>
> * Not listen on HTTP.
> * Close the connection with status code 400 (Bad Request) and not serve the request.
>
> To disable HTTP redirection in an API, set the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environment variable or use the `--urls` command line flag.

> ## HSTS and API projects
>
> The default API projects don't include [HSTS](#hsts) because [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) is generally a browser only instruction. Other callers, such as phone or desktop apps, do **not** obey the instruction. Even within browsers, a single authenticated call to an API over HTTP has risks on insecure networks. The secure approach is to configure API projects to only listen to and respond over HTTPS.

### HTTP redirection to HTTPS causes ERR_INVALID_REDIRECT on the CORS preflight request

Requests to an endpoint using HTTP that are redirected to HTTPS by [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A) fail with `ERR_INVALID_REDIRECT` on the CORS preflight request.

API projects can reject HTTP requests rather than use `UseHttpsRedirection` to redirect requests to HTTPS.

## Require HTTPS

We recommend that production ASP.NET Core web apps use:

* HTTPS redirection middleware ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A)) to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
* HSTS middleware ([UseHsts](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol)) to send HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocol headers to clients.

> **Note:**
> Apps deployed in a reverse proxy configuration allow the proxy to handle connection security (HTTPS). If the proxy also handles HTTPS redirection, there's no need to use HTTPS redirection middleware. If the proxy server also handles writing HSTS headers (for example, [native HSTS support in IIS 10.0 (1709) or later](https://learn.microsoft.com/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-10-version-1709/iis-10-version-1709-hsts#iis-100-version-1709-native-hsts-support)), HSTS middleware isn't required by the app. For more information, see [Opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS on project creation](#opt-out-of-httpshsts-on-project-creation).

### HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`)

The following code calls [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsPolicyBuilderExtensions.UseHttpsRedirection%252A) in the `Program.cs` file:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program.cs?highlight=13](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

The preceding highlighted code:

* Uses the default [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode) ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect)).
* Uses the default [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort) (null) unless overridden by the `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable or [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature).

We recommend using temporary redirects rather than permanent redirects. Link caching can cause unstable behavior in development environments. If you prefer to send a permanent redirect status code when the app is in a non-`Development` environment, see the [Configure permanent redirects in production](#configure-permanent-redirects-in-production) section. We recommend using [HSTS](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol) to signal to clients that only secure resource requests should be sent to the app (only in production).

> **Note:**
> Don't confuse the `HTTPS_PORT` configuration key and `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable, which set the port for HTTPS redirection middleware, with the `HTTPS_PORTS` configuration key and `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORTS` environment variable, which set the ports for Kestrel/HTTP.sys endpoint configuration.

### Port configuration

A port must be available for the middleware to redirect an insecure request to HTTPS. If no port is available:

* Redirection to HTTPS doesn't occur.
* The middleware logs the warning "Failed to determine the https port for redirect."

Specify the HTTPS port using any of the following approaches:

* Set [HttpsRedirectionOptions.HttpsPort](#options).
* Set the `https_port` [host setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fhost%2Fgeneric-host%23https_port):

  * In host configuration.
  * By setting the `ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT` environment variable.
  * By adding a top-level entry in `appsettings.json`:

    [Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/appsettings.json?highlight=2](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

* Indicate a port with the secure scheme using the [ASPNETCORE_URLS environment variable](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fhost%2Fgeneric-host%23urls). The environment variable configures the server. The middleware indirectly discovers the HTTPS port via [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature). This approach doesn't work in reverse proxy deployments.
* The ASP.NET Core web templates set an HTTPS URL in `Properties/launchsettings.json` for both Kestrel and IIS Express. `launchsettings.json` is only used on the local machine.
* Configure an HTTPS URL endpoint for a public-facing edge deployment of [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) server or [HTTP.sys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md) server. Only **one HTTPS port** is used by the app. The middleware discovers the port via [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature).

> **Note:**
> When an app is run in a reverse proxy configuration, [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.Server.Features.IServerAddressesFeature) isn't available. Set the port using one of the other approaches described in this section.

### Edge deployments

When [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) or [HTTP.sys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md) is used as a public-facing edge server, Kestrel or HTTP.sys must be configured to listen on both:

* The secure port where the client is redirected (typically, 443 in production and 5001 in development).
* The insecure port (typically, 80 in production and 5000 in development).

The insecure port must be accessible by the client in order for the app to receive an insecure request and redirect the client to the secure port.

For more information, see [Kestrel endpoint configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=fundamentals%2Fservers%2Fkestrel%23endpoint-configuration) or [fundamentals/servers/httpsys](../fundamentals/servers/httpsys.md).

### Deployment scenarios

Any firewall between the client and server must also have communication ports open for traffic.

If requests are forwarded in a reverse proxy configuration, use [forwarded headers middleware](../host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer.md) before calling HTTPS redirection middleware. Forwarded headers middleware updates the `Request.Scheme`, using the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header. The middleware permits redirect URIs and other security policies to work correctly. When forwarded headers middleware isn't used, the backend app might not receive the correct scheme and end up in a redirect loop. A common end user error message is that too many redirects have occurred.

When deploying to Azure App Service, follow the guidance in [Tutorial: Bind an existing custom SSL certificate to Azure Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-ssl).

### Options

The following highlighted code calls [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsRedirectionServicesExtensions.AddHttpsRedirection%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HttpsRedirectionServicesExtensions.AddHttpsRedirection%252A) to configure middleware options:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program2.cs?highlight=16-20](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

Calling `AddHttpsRedirection` is only necessary to change the values of `HttpsPort` or `RedirectStatusCode`.

The preceding highlighted code:

* Sets [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HttpsRedirectionOptions.RedirectStatusCode%252A) to [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect), which is the default value. Use the fields of the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes) class for assignments to `RedirectStatusCode`.
* Sets the HTTPS port to 5001.

#### Configure permanent redirects in production

The middleware defaults to sending a [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.StatusCodes.Status307TemporaryRedirect) with all redirects. If you prefer to send a permanent redirect status code when the app is in a non-`Development` environment, wrap the middleware options configuration in a conditional check for a non-`Development` environment.

When configuring services in `Program.cs`:

## HTTPS redirection middleware alternative approach

An alternative to using HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`) is to use URL rewriting middleware (`AddRedirectToHttps`). `AddRedirectToHttps` can also set the status code and port when the redirect is executed. For more information, see [URL rewriting middleware](../fundamentals/url-rewriting.md).

When redirecting to HTTPS without the requirement for additional redirect rules, we recommend using HTTPS redirection middleware (`UseHttpsRedirection`) described in this article.

## HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocol

Per [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/About_The_Open_Web_Application_Security_Project), [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) is an opt-in security enhancement that's specified by a web app through the use of a response header. When a [browser that supports HSTS](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.html#browser-support) receives this header:

* The browser stores configuration for the domain that prevents sending any communication over HTTP. The browser forces all communication over HTTPS.
* The browser prevents the user from using untrusted or invalid certificates. The browser disables prompts that allow a user to temporarily trust such a certificate.

Because [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) is enforced by the client, it has some limitations:

* The client must support HSTS.
* HSTS requires at least one successful HTTPS request to establish the HSTS policy.
* The application must check every HTTP request and redirect or reject the HTTP request.

ASP.NET Core implements HSTS with the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HstsBuilderExtensions.UseHsts%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder.HstsBuilderExtensions.UseHsts%252A) extension method. The following code calls `UseHsts` when the app isn't in [development mode](../fundamentals/environments.md):

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program.cs?highlight=10](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

`UseHsts` isn't recommended in development because the HSTS settings are highly cacheable by browsers. By default, `UseHsts` excludes the local loopback address.

For production environments that are implementing HTTPS for the first time, set the initial [Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HstsOptions.MaxAge%2A](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy.HstsOptions.MaxAge%252A) to a small value using one of the [System.TimeSpan](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?terms=System.TimeSpan) methods. Set the value from hours to no more than a single day in case you need to revert the HTTPS infrastructure to HTTP. After you're confident in the sustainability of the HTTPS configuration, increase the HSTS `max-age` value; a commonly used value is one year.

The following highlighted code:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: enforcing-ssl/includes/~/security/enforcing-ssl/sample-snapshot/6.x/Program2.cs?highlight=7-14](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/blob/970aa3fd243493b204e11c0f29472fd3f0399fee/aspnetcore/security/enforcing-ssl.md)

* Sets the preload parameter of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header. Preload isn't part of the [RFC HSTS specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797), but is supported by web browsers to preload HSTS sites on fresh install. For more information, see [https://hstspreload.org/](https://hstspreload.org/).
* Enables [includeSubDomain](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.2), which applies the HSTS policy to Host subdomains.
* Explicitly sets the `max-age` parameter of the `Strict-Transport-Security` header to 60 days. If not set, defaults to 30 days. For more information, see the [max-age directive](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797#section-6.1.1).
* Adds `example.com` to the list of hosts to exclude.

`UseHsts` excludes the following loopback hosts:

* `localhost` : The IPv4 loopback address.
* `127.0.0.1` : The IPv4 loopback address.
* `[::1]` : The IPv6 loopback address.

## Opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS on project creation

In some backend service scenarios where connection security is handled at the public-facing edge of the network, configuring connection security at each node isn't required. Web apps that are generated from the templates in Visual Studio or from the [dotnet new](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command enable [HTTPS redirection](#require-https) and [HSTS](#http-strict-transport-security-hsts-protocol). For deployments that don't require these scenarios, you can opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS when the app is created from the template.

To opt-out of HTTPS/HSTS:

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio) 

Uncheck the **Configure for HTTPS** checkbox.

New ASP.NET Core Web Application dialog showing the Configure for HTTPS checkbox unselected.

# [.NET CLI](#tab/net-cli) 

Use the `--no-https` option. For example

```dotnetcli
dotnet new webapp --no-https
```

## Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Windows and macOS

For the Firefox browser, see the next section.

The .NET SDK includes an HTTPS development certificate. The certificate is installed as part of the first-run experience. For example, `dotnet --info` produces a variation of the following output:

```cli
ASP.NET Core
------------
Successfully installed the ASP.NET Core HTTPS Development Certificate.
To trust the certificate run 'dotnet dev-certs https --trust' (Windows and macOS only).
For establishing trust on other platforms refer to the platform specific documentation.
For more information on configuring HTTPS see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848054.
```

Installing the .NET SDK installs the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate to the local user certificate store. The certificate has been installed, but it's not trusted. To trust the certificate, perform the one-time step to run the `dotnet dev-certs` tool:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

The following command provides help on the `dotnet dev-certs` tool:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --help
```

> **Warning:**
> Do not create a development certificate in an environment that will be redistributed, such as a container image or virtual machine. Doing so can lead to spoofing and elevation of privilege. To help prevent this, set the `DOTNET_GENERATE_ASPNET_CERTIFICATE` environment variable to `false` prior to calling the .NET CLI for the first time. This will skip the automatic generation of the ASP.NET Core development certificate during the CLI's first-run experience.

### Trust the HTTPS certificate with Firefox to prevent SEC_ERROR_INADEQUATE_KEY_USAGE error

The Firefox browser uses its own certificate store, and therefore doesn't trust the [IIS Express](https://learn.microsoft.com/iis/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview) or [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md) developer certificates.

There are two approaches to trusting the HTTPS certificate with Firefox, create a policy file or configure with the FireFox browser. Configuring with the browser creates the policy file, so the two approaches are equivalent.

#### Create a policy file to trust HTTPS certificate with Firefox

Create a policy file (`policies.json`) at:

* Windows: `%PROGRAMFILES%\Mozilla Firefox\distribution\`
* MacOS: `Firefox.app/Contents/Resources/distribution`
* Linux: See [Trust the certificate with Firefox on Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl?tabs=visual-studio%2Clinux-ubuntu%2Clinux-sles#trust-the-certificate-with-firefox-on-linux) in this article.

Add the following JSON to the Firefox policy file:

```json
{
  "policies": {
    "Certificates": {
      "ImportEnterpriseRoots": true
    }
  }
}
```

The preceding policy file makes Firefox trust certificates from the trusted certificates in the Windows certificate store. The next section provides an alternative approach to create the preceding policy file by using the Firefox browser.

<a name="trust-ff-ba"></a>

### Configure trust of HTTPS certificate using Firefox browser

Set  `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` = `true` using the following instructions:

1. Enter `about:config` in the FireFox browser.
1. Select **Accept the Risk and Continue** if you accept the risk.
1. Select **Show All**
1. Set `security.enterprise_roots.enabled` = `true`
1. Exit and restart Firefox

For more information, see [Setting Up Certificate Authorities (CAs) in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/setting-certificate-authorities-firefox) and the [mozilla/policy-templates/README file](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md).

## How to set up a developer certificate for Docker

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/6199).

## Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux

Establishing trust is distribution and browser specific. The following sections provide instructions for some popular distributions and the Chromium browsers (Edge and Chrome) and for Firefox.

### Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux with linux-dev-certs

[linux-dev-certs](https://github.com/tmds/linux-dev-certs) is an open-source, community-supported, .NET global tool that provides a convenient way to create and trust a developer certificate on Linux. The tool is not maintained or supported by Microsoft.

The following commands install the tool and create a trusted developer certificate:

```cli
dotnet tool update -g linux-dev-certs
dotnet linux-dev-certs install
```

For more information or to report issues, see the [linux-dev-certs GitHub repository](https://github.com/tmds/linux-dev-certs).

### Ubuntu trust the certificate for service-to-service communication

The following instructions don't work for some Ubuntu versions, such as 20.04. For more information, see GitHub issue [dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs #23686](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/23686).

1. Install [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) 1.1.1h or later. See your distribution for instructions on how to update OpenSSL.
1. Run the following commands:

    ```cli
    dotnet dev-certs https
    sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
    sudo update-ca-certificates
    ```

The preceding commands:

* Ensure the current user's developer certificate is created.
* Exports the certificate with elevated permissions needed for the `ca-certificates` folder, using the current user's environment.
* Removing the `-E`  flag exports the root user certificate, generating it if necessary. Each newly generated certificate has a different thumbprint. When running as root, `sudo`  and  `-E` are not needed.

The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

<a name="ssl-linux"></a>

### Trust HTTPS certificate on Linux using Edge or Chrome

# [Ubuntu](#tab/linux-ubuntu)

For chromium browsers on Linux:

* Install the `libnss3-tools` for your distribution.
* Create or verify the `$HOME/.pki/nssdb` folder exists on the machine.
* Export the certificate with the following command:

   ```cli
   dotnet dev-certs https
   sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
   ```

   The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

* Run the following commands:

   ```cli
   certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n localhost -i /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt
   ```

* Exit and restart the browser.

<a name="trust-ff-linux8"></a>

#### Trust the certificate with Firefox on Linux

* Export the certificate with the following command:

  ```vstscli
  dotnet dev-certs https
  sudo -E dotnet dev-certs https -ep /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt --format PEM
  ```

  The path in the preceding command is specific for Ubuntu. For other distributions, select an appropriate path or use the path for the Certificate Authorities (CAs).

* Create a JSON file at `/usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json` with the following command:

```sh
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json
{
    "policies": {
        "Certificates": {
            "Install": [
                "/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt"
            ]
        }
    }
}
EOF
```
Note: Ubuntu 21.10 Firefox comes as a snap package and the installation folder is `/snap/firefox/current/usr/lib/firefox`.
  
See [Configure trust of HTTPS certificate using Firefox browser](#trust-ff-ba) in this article for an alternative way to configure the policy file using the browser.

### Trust the certificate with Fedora 34

See:

* [This GitHub comment](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32361#issuecomment-837111639)
* [Fedora: Using Shared System Certificates](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/using-shared-system-certificates/)
* [Set up a .NET development environment](https://fedoramagazine.org/set-up-a-net-development-environment/) on Fedora.

### Trust the certificate with other distros

See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/32842).

## Trust HTTPS certificate from Windows Subsystem for Linux

The following instructions don't work for some Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu 20.04. For more information, see GitHub issue [dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs #23686](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore.Docs/issues/23686).

The [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about) generates an HTTPS self-signed development certificate, which by default isn't trusted in Windows. The easiest way to have Windows trust the WSL certificate, is to configure WSL to use the same certificate as Windows:

* On ***Windows***, export the developer certificate to a file:

  ```
  dotnet dev-certs https -ep https.pfx -p $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$ --trust
  ```
  Where `$CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$` is a password.

* In a WSL window, import the exported certificate on the WSL instance:

  ```
  dotnet dev-certs https --clean --import <<path-to-pfx>> --password $CREDENTIAL_PLACEHOLDER$
  ```

The preceding approach is a one time operation per certificate and per WSL distribution. It's easier than exporting the certificate over and over. If you update or regenerate the certificate on windows, you might need to run the preceding commands again.

<a name="tcp"></a>

## Troubleshoot certificate problems such as certificate not trusted

This section provides help when the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate has been [installed and trusted](#trust), but you still have browser warnings that the certificate is not trusted. The ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate is used by [Kestrel](../fundamentals/servers/kestrel.md).

To repair the IIS Express certificate, see [this Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20048613/502537) issue.

### All platforms - certificate not trusted

Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances open. Open a new browser window to app. Certificate trust is cached by browsers.

### dotnet dev-certs https --clean Fails

The preceding commands solve most browser trust issues. If the browser is still not trusting the certificate, follow the platform-specific suggestions that follow.

### Docker - certificate not trusted

* Delete the *C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Roaming\ASP.NET\Https* folder.
* Clean the solution. Delete the *bin* and *obj* folders.
* Restart the development tool. For example, Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

### Windows - certificate not trusted

* Check the certificates in the certificate store. There should be a `localhost` certificate with the `ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate` friendly name both under `Current User > Personal > Certificates` and `Current User > Trusted root certification authorities > Certificates`
* Remove all the found certificates from both Personal and Trusted root certification authorities. Do **not** remove the IIS Express localhost certificate.
* Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances open. Open a new browser window to app.

### OS X - certificate not trusted

* Open KeyChain Access.
* Select the System keychain.
* Check for the presence of a localhost certificate.
* Check that it contains a `+` symbol on the icon to indicate it's trusted for all users.
* Remove the certificate from the system keychain.
* Run the following commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

Close any browser instances open. Open a new browser window to app.

See [HTTPS Error using IIS Express (dotnet/AspNetCore #16892)](https://github.com/dotnet/AspNetCore/issues/16892) for troubleshooting certificate issues with Visual Studio.

### Linux certificate not trusted

Check that the certificate being configured for trust is the user HTTPS developer certificate that will be used by the Kestrel server.

Check the current user default HTTPS developer Kestrel certificate at the following location:

```
ls -la ~/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my
```

The HTTPS developer Kestrel certificate file is the SHA1 thumbprint. When the file is deleted via `dotnet dev-certs https --clean`, it's regenerated when needed with a different thumbprint.
Check the thumbprint of the exported certificate matches with the following command:

```
openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha1 -inform pem -in /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/aspnet/https.crt
```

If the certificate doesn't match, it could be one of the following:

* An old certificate.
* An exported a developer certificate for the root user. For this case, export the  certificate.

The root user certificate can be checked at:

```
ls -la /root/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/my
```

### IIS Express SSL certificate used with Visual Studio

To fix problems with the IIS Express certificate, select **Repair** from the Visual Studio installer. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/16892).

### Group policy prevents self-signed certificates from being trusted

In some cases, group policy may prevent self-signed certificates from being trusted. For more information, see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21173).
