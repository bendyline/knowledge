# Set up sign-up and sign-in with a Salesforce account using Azure Active Directory B2C


> **Important:**
> Effective May 1, 2025, Azure AD B2C will no longer be available to purchase for new customers. [Learn more in our FAQ](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/active-directory-b2c/faq.yml#azure-ad-b2c-end-of-sale).

***Before you begin***, use the **Choose a policy type** selector at the top of this page to choose the type of policy you’re setting up. Azure Active Directory B2C offers two methods to define how users interact with your applications: through predefined [user flows](user-flow-overview.md) or through fully configurable [custom policies](custom-policy-overview.md). The steps required in this article are different for each method. 	



**Applies to: b2c-custom-policy**


> **Note:**
> In Azure Active Directory B2C, [custom policies](user-flow-overview.md) are designed primarily to address complex scenarios. For most scenarios, we recommend that you use built-in [user flows](user-flow-overview.md). If you've not done so, learn about custom policy starter pack in [Get started with custom policies in Active Directory B2C](tutorial-create-user-flows.md).



## Prerequisites

**Applies to: b2c-user-flow**

* [Register a web application](tutorial-register-applications.md).



## Create a Salesforce application

To enable sign-in for users with a Salesforce account in Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), you need to create an application in your Salesforce [App Manager](https://login.salesforce.com/). For more information, see [Configure Basic Connected App Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=connected_app_create_basics.htm&language=en_US), and [Enable OAuth Settings for API Integration](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&language=en_US)

1. [Sign in to Salesforce](https://login.salesforce.com/).
1. From the menu, select **Setup**.
1.  Expand **Apps**, and then select **App Manager**.
1. Select **New Connected App**.
1. Under the **Basic Information**, enter:
    1. **Connected App Name** - The connected app name is displayed in the App Manager and on its App Launcher tile. The name must be unique within your org. 
    1. **API Name** 
    1. **Contact Email** - The contact email for Salesforce
1. Under **API (Enable OAuth Settings)**, select **Enable OAuth Settings**
    1. For the **Callback URL**, enter `https://your-tenant-name.b2clogin.com/your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`. If you use a [custom domain](custom-domain.md), enter `https://your-domain-name/your-tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com/oauth2/authresp`. Replace `your-tenant-name` with the name of your tenant, and `your-domain-name` with your custom domain. You need to use all lowercase letters when entering your tenant name even if the tenant is defined with uppercase letters in Azure AD B2C.
    1. In the **Selected OAuth Scopes**, select **Access the identity URL service (id, profile, email, address, phone)**, and **Allow access to your unique identifier (openid)**.
    1. Select **Require Secret for Web Server Flow**.
1. Select **Configure ID Token** 
    1. Set the **Token Valid for** 5 minutes.
    1. Select **Include Standard Claims**.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Copy the values of **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**. You will need both of them to configure Salesforce as an identity provider in your tenant. **Client secret** is an important security credential.

**Applies to: b2c-user-flow**


## Configure Salesforce as an identity provider

1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Azure AD B2C tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Select **Identity providers**, and then select **New OpenID Connect provider**.
1. Enter a **Name**. For example, enter *Salesforce*.
1. For **Metadata url**, enter the URL of the [Salesforce OpenID Connect Configuration document](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=remoteaccess_using_openid_discovery_endpoint.htm&language=en_US). For a sandbox, login.salesforce.com is replaced with test.salesforce.com. For a community, login.salesforce.com is replaced with the community URL, such as username.force.com/.well-known/openid-configuration. The URL must be HTTPS.

    ```
    https://login.salesforce.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
    ```

1. For **Client ID**, enter the application ID that you previously recorded.
1. For **Client secret**, enter the client secret that you previously recorded.
1. For the **Scope**, enter the `openid id profile email`.
1. Leave the default values for **Response type**, and **Response mode**.
1. (Optional) For the **Domain hint**, enter `contoso.com`. For more information, see [Set up direct sign-in using Azure Active Directory B2C](direct-signin.md#redirect-sign-in-to-a-social-provider).
1. Under **Identity provider claims mapping**, select the following claims:

    - **User ID**: *sub*
    - **Display name**: *name*
    - **Given name**: *given_name*
    - **Surname**: *family_name*
    - **Email**: *email*

1. Select **Save**.

## Add Salesforce identity provider to a user flow 

At this point, the Salesforce identity provider has been set up, but it's not yet available in any of the sign-in pages. To add the Salesforce identity provider to a user flow:

1. In your Azure AD B2C tenant, select **User flows**.
1. Click the user flow that you want to add the Salesforce identity provider.
1. Under the **Social identity providers**, select **Salesforce**.
1. Select **Save**.
1. To test your policy, select **Run user flow**.
1. For **Application**, select the web application named *testapp1* that you previously registered. The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.
1. Select the **Run user flow** button.
1. From the sign-up or sign-in page, select **Salesforce** to sign in with Salesforce account.

If the sign-in process is successful, your browser is redirected to `https://jwt.ms`, which displays the contents of the token returned by Azure AD B2C.



**Applies to: b2c-custom-policy**


## Create a policy key

You need to store the client secret that you previously recorded in your Azure AD B2C tenant.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. If you have access to multiple tenants, select the **Settings** icon in the top menu to switch to your Azure AD B2C tenant from the **Directories + subscriptions** menu.
1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. On the Overview page, select **Identity Experience Framework**.
1. Select **Policy Keys** and then select **Add**.
1. For **Options**, choose `Manual`.
1. Enter a **Name** for the policy key. For example, `SalesforceSecret`. The prefix `B2C_1A_` is added automatically to the name of your key.
1. In **Secret**, enter your client secret that you previously recorded.
1. For **Key usage**, select `Signature`.
1. Click **Create**.

## Configure Salesforce as an identity provider

To enable users to sign in using a Salesforce account, you need to define the account as a claims provider that Azure AD B2C can communicate with through an endpoint. The endpoint provides a set of claims that are used by Azure AD B2C to verify that a specific user has authenticated.

You can define a Salesforce account as a claims provider by adding it to the **ClaimsProviders** element in the extension file of your policy.

1. Open the *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml*.
2. Find the **ClaimsProviders** element. If it does not exist, add it under the root element.
3. Add a new **ClaimsProvider** as follows:

    ```xml
    <ClaimsProvider>
      <Domain>salesforce.com</Domain>
      <DisplayName>Salesforce</DisplayName>
      <TechnicalProfiles>
        <TechnicalProfile Id="Salesforce-OpenIdConnect">
          <DisplayName>Salesforce</DisplayName>
          <Protocol Name="OpenIdConnect" />
          <Metadata>
            <Item Key="METADATA">https://login.salesforce.com/.well-known/openid-configuration</Item>
            <Item Key="response_types">code</Item>
            <Item Key="response_mode">form_post</Item>
            <Item Key="scope">openid id profile email</Item>
            <Item Key="HttpBinding">POST</Item>
            <Item Key="UsePolicyInRedirectUri">0</Item>
            <!-- Update the Client ID below to the Application ID -->
            <Item Key="client_id">Your Salesforce application ID</Item>
          </Metadata>
          <CryptographicKeys>
            <Key Id="client_secret" StorageReferenceId="B2C_1A_SalesforceSecret"/>
          </CryptographicKeys>
          <OutputClaims>
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="issuerUserId" PartnerClaimType="sub" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="givenName" PartnerClaimType="given_name" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="surname" PartnerClaimType="family_name" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="displayName" PartnerClaimType="name" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="email" PartnerClaimType="email" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="identityProvider" DefaultValue="salesforce.com" AlwaysUseDefaultValue="true" />
            <OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId="authenticationSource" DefaultValue="socialIdpAuthentication" AlwaysUseDefaultValue="true" />
          </OutputClaims>
          <OutputClaimsTransformations>
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateRandomUPNUserName" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateUserPrincipalName" />
            <OutputClaimsTransformation ReferenceId="CreateAlternativeSecurityId" />
          </OutputClaimsTransformations>
          <UseTechnicalProfileForSessionManagement ReferenceId="SM-SocialLogin" />
        </TechnicalProfile>
      </TechnicalProfiles>
    </ClaimsProvider>
    ```

4. The **METADATA** is set to the URL of the [Salesforce OpenID Connect Configuration document](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=remoteaccess_using_openid_discovery_endpoint.htm&language=en_US). For a sandbox, login.salesforce.com is replaced with test.salesforce.com. For a community, login.salesforce.com is replaced with the community URL, such as username.force.com/.well-known/openid-configuration. The URL must be HTTPS.
5. Set **client_id** to the application ID from the application registration.
6. Save the file.

## Add a user journey 

At this point, the identity provider has been set up, but it's not yet available in any of the sign-in pages. If you don't have your own custom user journey, create a duplicate of an existing template user journey, otherwise continue to the next step. 

1. Open the *TrustFrameworkBase.xml* file from the starter pack.
1. Find and copy the entire contents of the **UserJourney** element that includes `Id="SignUpOrSignIn"`.
1. Open the *TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml* and find the **UserJourneys** element. If the element doesn't exist, add one.
1. Paste the entire content of the **UserJourney** element that you copied as a child of the **UserJourneys** element.
1. Rename the Id of the user journey. For example, `Id="CustomSignUpSignIn"`.

## Add the identity provider to a user journey 

Now that you have a user journey, add the new identity provider to the user journey. You first add a sign-in button, then link the button to an action. The action is the technical profile you created earlier.

1. Find the orchestration step element that includes `Type="CombinedSignInAndSignUp"`, or `Type="ClaimsProviderSelection"` in the user journey. It's usually the first orchestration step. The **ClaimsProviderSelections** element contains a list of identity providers that a user can sign in with. The order of the elements controls the order of the sign-in buttons presented to the user. Add a **ClaimsProviderSelection** XML element. Set the value of **TargetClaimsExchangeId** to a friendly name.

1. In the next orchestration step, add a **ClaimsExchange** element. Set the **Id** to the value of the target claims exchange Id. Update the value of **TechnicalProfileReferenceId** to the Id of the technical profile you created earlier.

The following XML demonstrates the first two orchestration steps of a user journey with the identity provider:


```xml
<OrchestrationStep Order="1" Type="CombinedSignInAndSignUp" ContentDefinitionReferenceId="api.signuporsignin">
  <ClaimsProviderSelections>
    ...
    <ClaimsProviderSelection TargetClaimsExchangeId="SalesforceExchange" />
  </ClaimsProviderSelections>
  ...
</OrchestrationStep>

<OrchestrationStep Order="2" Type="ClaimsExchange">
  ...
  <ClaimsExchanges>
    <ClaimsExchange Id="SalesforceExchange" TechnicalProfileReferenceId="Salesforce-OpenIdConnect" />
  </ClaimsExchanges>
</OrchestrationStep>
```

## Configure the relying party policy

The relying party policy, for example [SignUpSignIn.xml](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-custom-policy-starterpack/blob/master/SocialAndLocalAccounts/SignUpOrSignin.xml), specifies the user journey which Azure AD B2C will execute. Find the **DefaultUserJourney** element within [relying party](relyingparty.md). Update the  **ReferenceId** to match the user journey ID, in which you added the identity provider. 

In the following example, for the `CustomSignUpSignIn` user journey, the **ReferenceId** is set to `CustomSignUpSignIn`:

```xml
<RelyingParty>
  <DefaultUserJourney ReferenceId="CustomSignUpSignIn" />
  ...
</RelyingParty>
```

### Upload the custom policy

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select the **Directory + Subscription** icon in the portal toolbar, and then select the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant.
1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Under **Policies**, select **Identity Experience Framework**.
1. Select **Upload Custom Policy**, and then upload the two policy files that you changed, in the following order: the extension policy, for example `TrustFrameworkExtensions.xml`, then the relying party policy, such as `SignUpSignIn.xml`.





## Test your custom policy

1. Select your relying party policy, for example `B2C_1A_signup_signin`.
1. For **Application**, select a web application that you [previously registered](tutorial-register-applications.md). The **Reply URL** should show `https://jwt.ms`.
1. Select the **Run now** button.
1. From the sign-up or sign-in page, select **Salesforce** to sign in with Salesforce account.

If the sign-in process is successful, your browser is redirected to `https://jwt.ms`, which displays the contents of the token returned by Azure AD B2C.
