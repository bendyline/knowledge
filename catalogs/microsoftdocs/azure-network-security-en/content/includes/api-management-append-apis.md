## Append other APIs

You can compose an API out of APIs that are exposed by different services, including:

- An OpenAPI specification
- A SOAP API
- A GraphQL API
- A Web App that's hosted in Azure App Service
- Azure Functions
- Azure Logic Apps
- Azure Service Fabric

> **Note:**
> 
> When you import an API, the operations are appended to your current API.

To append an API to an existing API: 

1. Go to your Azure API Management instance in the Azure portal:
