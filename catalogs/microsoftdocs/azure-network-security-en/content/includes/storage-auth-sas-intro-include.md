A shared access signature (SAS) enables you to grant limited access to containers and blobs in your storage account. When you create a SAS, you specify its constraints, including which Azure Storage resources a client is allowed to access, what permissions they have on those resources, and how long the SAS is valid.

Every SAS is signed with a key. You can sign a SAS in one of two ways:

- With a key created using Microsoft Entra credentials. A SAS that is signed with Microsoft Entra credentials is a *user delegation* SAS. A client that creates a user delegation SAS must be assigned an Azure RBAC role that includes the **Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/generateUserDelegationKey** action. To learn more, see [Create a user delegation SAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/create-user-delegation-sas#assign-permissions-with-rbac).
- With the storage account key. Both a *service SAS* and an *account SAS* are signed with the storage account key. The client that creates a service SAS must either have direct access to the account key or be assigned the **Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action** permission. To learn more, see [Create a service SAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/create-service-sas) or [Create an account SAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/create-account-sas).

> **Note:**
> A user delegation SAS offers superior security to a SAS that is signed with the storage account key. Microsoft recommends using a user delegation SAS when possible.
