# Set up Frontline Agent for frontline workers

### Overview

Frontline Agent is an AI-powered assistant in Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Teams designed to support frontline workers and managers in their day-to-day operations. It helps frontline teams stay informed, complete tasks, and access the right information at the right time, all within the flow of work.

Frontline Agent works alongside Teams chats, channels, and existing Microsoft 365 services such as SharePoint, enabling organizations to scale frontline communication and operations without introducing new tools or workflows.

Built on Microsoft 365, Frontline Agent works within your existing Microsoft Teams security and compliance framework. You can use Microsoft Purview to mitigate and manage the risk associated with AI usage, including with Frontline Agent [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/ai-microsoft-purview). 

The agent is currently rolling out for users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license. As an IT administrator, you set up Frontline Agent to ensure it aligns with your organization's policies for security, compliance, and device management.

### What scenarios does Frontline Agent enable?

__Quick access to information and guidance__

Frontline Agent allows workers to quickly find answers, documents, and guidance from approved sources such as SharePoint or Teams channels. This quick guidance is essential in environments with frequent employee turnover or limited time for training.

__Catch up on missed communications at the start of a shift__

Frontline Agent helps frontline workers quickly catch up on important messages, updates, and tasks at the start of a shift without scrolling through long chat histories. It summarizes relevant conversations and highlights any actions that need to be taken, reducing missed information.

__Draft end-of-shift handovers__

Frontline Agent helps frontline managers create clear and consistent end-of-shift handovers, ensuring continuity across shifts. It summarizes completed work, flags open items, and captures key updates that need to be passed to the next shift all from Teams chat and channel messages. 

### Prerequisites

1. __Identify the scenarios and training plan:__ Based on your organization's frontline workflows and the agent's capabilities, establish the most likely used prompts. Share these prompts with your frontline workers and set up a one-time training session to help them understand how to use the agent.

2. __Select an initial group of users:__ We suggest launching the agent at a few locations that are already using Microsoft Teams so you can observe how your frontline workers are adopting the use cases.

3. __Purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot and assign licenses:__ Work with your sales team to purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses for the initial set of users.

### How to set it up

The agent is discoverable from the Microsoft 365 Copilot app store for all users who have the Microsoft 365 Copilot license. To pin the agent for those users in Microsoft 365 Copilot, click [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/agent-registry?). If you'd like the agent to also show up in the Teams chat rail or scope down the SharePoint sites the agent has access to, follow these instructions.

> **Note:**
> If you don't scope down to a set of SharePoint sites, the agent provides answers from all the sites each user has access to.

1. Go to **Teams Admin center** > **Frontline management** > **Manage frontline teams** and then select **Agents**.

   Screenshot indicates Agents page and lists the Frontline Agent.

2. Click **Frontline Agent**. To limit the agent to specific SharePoint sites, paste in each Home site URL. If you add 10 sites and a user only has access to two, the agent uses information from only those two sites.
