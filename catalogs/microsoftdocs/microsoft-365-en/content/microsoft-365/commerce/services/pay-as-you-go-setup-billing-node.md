# Set up or disconnect pay-as-you-go in the Billing node of the Microsoft 365 admin center

This article explains how to set up or disconnect pay-as-you-go billing in the **Billing** node of the Microsoft 365 admin center for the following services:

- Copilot
- Microsoft 365 Backup
- High Volume Email

> **Note:**
> Government Community Cloud (GCC) and new Backup customers only. Existing backup customers must continue in the **Setup** node. For more information, see [Set up or disconnect pay-as-you-go billing in the Setup node of the Microsoft 365 admin center](pay-as-you-go-setup.md).

## Before you begin

- To access the Microsoft 365 admin center, you must have one of the following roles:

  - [SharePoint Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#sharepoint-administrator)
  - [Billing Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?#billing-administrator)
  - [AI Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?#ai-administrator)
  - [Global Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator)
  
    
> **Caution:**
> Global Administrators have almost unlimited access to your organization's settings and most of its data. To help keep your organization secure, we recommend that you limit the number of Global Administrators as much as possible.

    
- You must have Owner or Contributor rights to the Azure subscription and resource group.
- The tenant must have at least one SharePoint license, or a license that includes SharePoint.
- You must have an Azure subscription in the same tenant as Microsoft 365.
- You must have an Azure resource group in that subscription.

## Set up pay-as-you-go billing in the Billing node

To set up pay-as-you-go billing in the **Billing** node, first set up a billing policy, and then connect it to a pay-as-you-go service.

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
1. Go to **Billing** > **Pay-as-you-go**.
1. Select **Add a billing policy**.
1. On the **Billing details** page, fill in the required information, including:

   - Policy name
   - Azure subscription
   - Resource group
   - Region (determines where tenant ID and usage data are stored)

1. Read and accept the pay-as-you-go terms of service, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Users** page, choose **All users** or a **Specific group** (search for and add a single group). Select **Next**.

    > **Note:**
    > When you select a group, only the first 1,000 groups are displayed in alphabetical order.

1. On the **Review and finish** page, double-check all the details you entered. If everything is correct, select **Create policy**.
1. On the **Services** page, select the service you want to connect, and then select **Connect a policy**.
1. Select the new billing policy and link it to a pay-as-you-go service, like **Microsoft 365 Backup**.

    > **Note:**
    > For any Copilot services, when you select **Connect a policy**, the page directs you to the Copilot **Billing & Usage** page. Select **Go to Copilot Billing & usage** to be redirected.

## Monitor usage and costs

After setup, monitor your pay-as-you-go usage and costs in [Microsoft Cost Management for Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/Menu/costanalysis). Ensure you have at least read access to the billing resource group.

## Disconnect pay-as-you-go billing

1. Go to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, and then go to **Billing** > **Pay-as-you-go**.
1. On the **Services** page, select the service you want to disconnect.
1. Under **Billing Policies**, select the toggle to turn it off.
1. Select **Save**.

After you disconnect the service, review your billing and usage to ensure no further charges are applied.
