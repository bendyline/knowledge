# Set up or disconnect pay-as-you-go billing in the Copilot node of the Microsoft 365 admin center

This article explains how to set up or disconnect pay-as-you-go billing in the **Copilot** node of the Microsoft 365 admin center for agents.

## Before you begin

- To access the Microsoft 365 admin center, you must have one of the following roles:

  - [Global Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator)
  - [Billing Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?#billing-administrator)
  - [AI Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference?#ai-administrator)

  
> **Caution:**
> Global Administrators have almost unlimited access to your organization's settings and most of its data. To help keep your organization secure, we recommend that you limit the number of Global Administrators as much as possible.


- The tenant must have at least one SharePoint license, or a license that includes SharePoint.
- You must have an Azure subscription in the same tenant as Microsoft 365.
- You must have an Azure resource group in that subscription.

## Set up pay-as-you-go billing in the Copilot node

To set up pay-as-you-go billing, first set up a billing policy, and then connect it to a pay-as-you-go service.

1. Sign in to the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>.
1. Go to **Copilot** > **Billing & usage**.
1. Select **Add a billing policy**.
1. On the **Billing details** page, fill in the required information, including the following items:

   - Policy name
   - Azure subscription
   - Resource group
   - Region (determines where the tenant ID and usage data are stored)

1. Read and accept the pay-as-you-go terms of service. Select **Next**.
1. On the **Users** page, choose **All users** or a **Specific group** (search for and add a single group). Select **Next**.

    > **Note:**
    > When you select a group, only the first 1,000 groups are displayed in alphabetical order.

1. On the **Review and finish** page, double-check all the details you entered. If everything is correct, select **Create policy**.
1. On the **Billing & usage** page, select the **Connect a service**.
1. Select the new billing policy and link it to a pay-as-you-go service, like **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** or **SharePoint Agents**.

## Create a budget and monitor usage and cost

After setting up billing, you can [create a budget and monitor your usage in the Microsoft 365 admin center](pay-as-you-go-budget.md). You can also monitor your pay-as-you-go usage and costs in [Microsoft Cost Management for Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/Menu/costanalysis). Ensure you have at least read access to the billing resource group.

## Disconnect pay-as-you-go billing

To disconnect agents from pay-as-you-go billing, use the following steps.

1. In the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">Microsoft 365 admin center</a>, go to **Copilot** > **Billing & usage**.
1. Select the **Pay-as-you-go services** tab.
1. Select the agent to disconnect, like **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** or **SharePoint Agents**.
1. In the **Manage billing policy connections** panel, select the check box next to the policy to disconnect, and then select **Save**.
1. View the disconnection message to confirm that your Azure subscription is successfully disconnected.

If multiple services connect to a single policy, repeat the steps for each service.

After you disconnect the service, review your billing and usage to ensure no further charges are applied.
