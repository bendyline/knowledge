# Connect DNS records at Namecheap to Microsoft 365

If Namecheap hosts your domain's DNS, follow the steps in this article to verify domain ownership and manually add the DNS records required for Microsoft 365 services such as email, Microsoft Teams, and device management. After you add these records at Namecheap, your domain is ready to work with Microsoft 365.

This article covers the creation of the following DNS records at Namecheap:

| **Service** | **DNS record types** |
| --- | --- |
| [**Domain verification**](create-dns-records-at-namecheap.md?&tabs=domain-verify#add-microsoft-365-dns-records-at-namecheap) | TXT |
| [**Email**](create-dns-records-at-namecheap.md?&tabs=email#add-microsoft-365-dns-records-at-namecheap) | MX, CNAME (Autodiscover), TXT (SPF) |
| [**Microsoft Teams**](create-dns-records-at-namecheap.md?&tabs=teams#add-microsoft-365-dns-records-at-namecheap) | SRV (2), CNAME (2) |
| [**Microsoft Intune/MDM**](create-dns-records-at-namecheap.md?&tabs=intune-mdm#add-microsoft-365-dns-records-at-namecheap) | CNAME (2) |

> **Note:**
>
> Namecheap is a non-Microsoft site. Microsoft doesn't control the Namecheap site. Additionally, Namecheap might change their website and tools so that the steps in this article are no longer valid. For support with Namecheap's site and tools, contact Namecheap support.

## Before you begin

- You must own a domain registered with Namecheap.
- You must add the domain in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339). If the domain isn't added in the Microsoft 365 admin center, follow the steps in [Add a domain](https://learn.microsoft.com/admin/setup/add-domain#add-a-domain) to add your domain before you start adding DNS records at Namecheap.


> **Note:**
>
> When creating or updating DNS records, it typically takes about 15 minutes for DNS changes to take effect. However, it can occasionally take longer for a DNS record change to update across the Internet's DNS system. If you're having trouble with mail flow or other issues after adding DNS records, see [Find and fix issues after adding your domain or DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/find-and-fix-issues.md).


## Sign in to Namecheap to manage your domain's DNS records

To add DNS records at Namecheap, sign in to your Namecheap account and then go to the page where you can manage your domain's DNS records. Follow these steps to get there:

1. Sign in to your Namecheap domains page by going to the Namecheap [Log in to your account](https://www.namecheap.com/myaccount/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2f) page.

     Screenshot of the Namecheap sign in page.

1. On the landing page, under **Account**, choose **Domain List** from the drop-down list.

     Screenshot of the Account drop-down with Domain List selected.

1. On the **Domain List** page, select the domain that you want to edit, and then select **Manage**.

     Screenshot of the Domain List page with the Manage option highlighted.

1. Select **Advanced DNS**.

## Add Microsoft 365 DNS records at Namecheap

To add required DNS records at Namecheap for Microsoft 365 services, select the tab based on which DNS records you need to add:

- [**Domain Verification**](create-dns-records-at-namecheap.md?&tabs=domain-verify#add-microsoft-365-dns-records-at-namecheap).
- [**Email**](create-dns-records-at-namecheap.md?&tabs=email#add-microsoft-365-dns-records-at-namecheap).
- [**Microsoft Teams**](create-dns-records-at-namecheap.md?&tabs=teams#add-microsoft-365-dns-records-at-namecheap).
- [**Microsoft Intune/Mobile Device Management for Microsoft 365**](create-dns-records-at-namecheap.md?&tabs=intune-mdm#add-microsoft-365-dns-records-at-namecheap).

### [ **Domain Verify**](#tab/domain-verify)

#### Add a TXT record for domain ownership verification

Before you can use your domain with Microsoft 365, you need to prove you own the domain. Your ability to sign in to your account at your domain registrar and create the DNS record proves to Microsoft that you own the domain. This process involves creating a TXT record at your domain registrar with a specific value that Microsoft can look for. When Microsoft finds the record with the correct value, your domain is verified. The TXT record is used only to verify that you own your domain. It doesn't affect anything else and can be deleted once domain verification is complete.

> **Note:**
>
> The procedures in this section assume that the process of [adding a domain](https://learn.microsoft.com/admin/setup/add-domain#add-a-domain) is started, but that domain ownership isn't verified yet.

To add the TXT record for domain verification at Namecheap, follow these steps:

1. Get the **TXT** value specific for your domain from the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339). For help on finding the value of your TXT record in the Microsoft 365 admin center, see [Gather the information you need to create DNS records](../get-help-with-domains/information-for-dns-records.md#step-1-find-the-txt-record-value-and-verify).

1. If you're not already signed in to the Namecheap **Advanced DNS** page for your domain, follow the steps in [Sign in to Namecheap to manage your domain's DNS records](#sign-in-to-namecheap-to-manage-your-domains-dns-records) to get there.

1. In the **HOST RECORDS** section, select **ADD NEW RECORD**.

     Screenshot of the Host Records section with ADD NEW RECORD highlighted.

1. In the **Type** drop-down, select **TXT Record**. The **Type** drop-down automatically appears when you select **ADD NEW RECORD**.

     Screenshot of the Type drop-down with TXT Record selected for domain verification.

1. In the boxes for the new record, enter the values from the following table:

    | **Type** | **Host** | **Value** | **TTL** |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | TXT | @ | *MS=msXXXXXXXX* | 30 min |

    - Use the TXT value you gathered earlier from the Microsoft 365 admin center. The value *MS=msXXXXXXXX* shown in the table is only an example.
    - Choose the **TTL** value from the drop-down list.

1. Select the **Save Changes** ✅ check mark icon or select the **Save All Changes** button located just below the record you added.

     Screenshot of the Save Changes control for the domain verification TXT record.

1. Wait a few minutes for the TXT record to propagate before continuing.

Now that the TXT record is added at your domain registrar's site, go back to the Microsoft 365 admin center and complete the domain ownership verification process. When Microsoft 365 finds the correct TXT record, your domain is verified.

To verify the record in the Microsoft 365 admin center, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339).

1. From the left navigation bar, select **… Show all**, and then select **Settings** to expand it.

1. Under **Settings**, select [**Domains**](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834818).

1. In the **Domains** page, select the ellipsis **⋮** next to the domain that you're verifying, and then select **Start setup**.

    Screenshot of the Domains page with Start setup selected.

1. In the **Verify you own your domain** page, make sure **Add a TXT record to the domain's DNS records** is selected, and then select **Continue**.

1. On the **Add a record to verify domain ownership** page, select **Verify**.

1. After you verify domain ownership, the **How do you want to connect your domain?** page appears. The rest of the wizard walks you through adding additional DNS records to connect your domain to Microsoft 365 services. For more information, see the following article or the following sections in this article:
