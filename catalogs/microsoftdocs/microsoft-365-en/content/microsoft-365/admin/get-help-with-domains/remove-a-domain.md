# Remove a domain from Microsoft 365

You can remove a domain from Microsoft 365 when you want to [add it to a different subscription plan](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/blob/eab9d7696cdff87474698b08a1fb328091102a2f/microsoft-365/commerce/subscriptions/switch-to-a-different-plan.md), transfer users to another domain, or [cancel your subscription](../../commerce/subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription.md).

## Before you begin

Before you remove a domain, make sure that:

- The domain isn't the default domain.
- No users, shared mailboxes, resource mailboxes, or contacts use the domain.
- No Microsoft 365 groups, distribution lists, or teams use the domain.
- The domain isn't used for sign-in by any admin accounts.
- You understand how email flow changes if the domain has MX records pointing to Microsoft 365.

## Step 1: Move users to another domain

### Move users

**Applies to: o365-worldwide**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339).

1. Select **Users** > **Active users**.

1. Select the check boxes next to the names of all the users you want to move.

1. At the top of the page, select **Change domains**.

1. In the **Change domains** pane, select a different domain.

    You need to do this step for yourself, too, if you're on the domain that you want to remove. When you edit the domain for your account, sign out and sign back in by using the new domain you chose to continue.

### Move yourself

> **Important:**
>
> If you're the only Global Administrator using this domain, make sure at least one other Global Administrator exists on a different domain before you change your username.

**Applies to: o365-worldwide**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339).



   **Applies to: o365-21vianet**

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627).

1. In the domain properties pane, select **Remove domain**.

1. In the **Remove domain?** pane, select **Remove domain**.

## Remove a custom domain

If you're canceling your subscription and using a custom domain, you need to complete a few extra steps with your custom domain before canceling your subscription.

Your domain registrar and DNS hosting provider are often the same company, but they can be different. The registrar manages your domain registration, while the DNS hosting provider manages the DNS records that route traffic for your domain. To determine who your registrar and DNS hosting provider are, see [Find your domain registrar and DNS hosting provider](find-your-domain-registrar.md).

To remove a custom domain from Microsoft 365, select the tab based on where your domain nameservers (NS) are hosted:

- **NS at Microsoft 365** - Nameservers (NS) currently point to Microsoft 365. Select this option even if you plan to move to a new NS provider.
- **NS at non-Microsoft provider** - Nameservers (NS) currently point to a non-Microsoft provider.

### [ **NS at Microsoft 365**](#tab/ns-at-microsoft-365)

If your domain currently points to Microsoft 365 nameservers (NS), follow the steps in this section to properly move the domain to new NS and service providers.

1. Update your DNS records at both Microsoft 365 and your new NS provider to point to your new provider's services. For example, point your MX record to your new email provider at both Microsoft 365 and your new NS provider. For more information on changing your DNS records at Microsoft 365, see [Change DNS records to set up Microsoft 365 with any domain registrar](../setup/add-domain.md). For more information on changing your DNS records at your new NS provider, see your new NS provider's documentation.

1. Once you update the DNS records at both Microsoft 365 and your new NS provider, change your NS records at your registrar to point to your new NS provider instead of Microsoft 365. For more information, see [Add a custom domain to Microsoft 365](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/microsoft-365-docs/blob/eab9d7696cdff87474698b08a1fb328091102a2f/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-with-domains/change-nameservers-at-any-domain-registrar.md).

    > **Tip:**
    >
    > Before moving to your new NS provider, you can configure DNS records at your new NS provider ahead of time. At your new NS provider, configure your DNS records to point to your new service provider while leaving the DNS records unchanged at Microsoft 365.
    >
    > On the day you want to move your NS records to the new NS provider, update your DNS records at Microsoft 365 to match the DNS records at your new NS provider. Once you update the DNS records in Microsoft 365, change your NS records to point to your new NS provider.
    >
    > This approach allows you to set up your DNS records at your new NS provider ahead of time and then switch to the new NS provider when you're ready.

1. Notify your users of the date you plan to switch them to their new service provider along with the new service provider's name. For example, notify your users that their email is being moved to a new email provider. Although the switch usually happens seamlessly, it's a good idea to let your users know about the change.

1. On the day you change the NS and DNS records:

   - Save user data that is in Microsoft 365. For more information, see [Save your data](../../commerce/subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription.md#save-your-data).

   - If needed, uninstall Microsoft 365 from user's devices. For more information, see [Uninstall Microsoft 365](../../commerce/subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription.md#uninstall-microsoft-365-optional).

### [ **NS at non-Microsoft provider**](#tab/ns-at-non-microsoft-provider)

If your domain currently points to non-Microsoft nameservers (NS), complete the following steps to properly move the domain to a new service provider:

1. Update your DNS records at your NS provider to point to your new provider's services. For example, point your MX record to your new email provider at your new NS provider. For information on changing your DNS records at your NS provider, see your new NS provider's documentation.

1. Notify your users of the date you plan to switch them to their new service provider along with the new service provider's name. For example, notify your users that their email is being moved to a new email provider. Although the switch usually happens seamlessly, it's a good idea to let your users know about the change.

1. On the day you change the DNS records:

   - Save user data that is in Microsoft 365. For more information, see [Save your data](../../commerce/subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription.md#save-your-data).

   - If needed, uninstall Microsoft 365 from user's devices. For more information, see [Uninstall Microsoft 365](../../commerce/subscriptions/cancel-your-subscription.md#uninstall-microsoft-365-optional).

## How long does it take for a domain to be removed?

It can take as little as five minutes for Microsoft 365 to remove a domain if the domain isn't referenced in many places such as:

- Security groups.
- Distribution lists.
- Users.
- Aliases.
- Shared mailboxes.
- Resource mailboxes.
- Microsoft 365 groups.

If many references use the domain, it can take several hours up to a day for the domain to be removed.

> **Tip:**
>
> If you have hundreds or thousands of users, use PowerShell to query for all users and then move them to another domain. Otherwise, it's possible for some users to be missed via the UI. If not all users are properly moved, the domain can't be removed. For more information, see the following PowerShell cmdlets:
>
> - Query users and move to another domain: [Update-MgUser](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.users/update-mguser).
> - Set the default domain: [Update-MgDomain](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.identity.directorymanagement/update-mgdomain).
