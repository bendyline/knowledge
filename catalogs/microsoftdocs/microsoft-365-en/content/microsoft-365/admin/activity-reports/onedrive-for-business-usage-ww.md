# OneDrive usage report - Microsoft 365 admin center

The OneDrive usage report provides a high-level view of the value you get from OneDrive. The report includes details about the total number of accounts, files, and storage used across your organization. You can drill into it to understand the trends of active OneDrive accounts, how many files users are interacting with, and the amount of storage used. It also gives you details for each user's OneDrive.
