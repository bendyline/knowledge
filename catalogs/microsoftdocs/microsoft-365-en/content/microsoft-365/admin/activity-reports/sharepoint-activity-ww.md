# SharePoint activity report - Microsoft 365 admin center

The SharePoint activity report provides details about the activity of every licensed SharePoint user by looking at their interaction with files. The report helps you understand the level of collaboration by showing the number of files shared.


For general information about Microsoft 365 Usage reports and to see a list of all available reports, see [Microsoft 365 admin center usage reports overview](activity-reports.md).

The SharePoint activity report displays trends over the last 7, 30, 90, or 180 days. However, if you select a particular day in the report, the table shows data for up to 28 days from the current date (not the date the report was generated).

By default, user-specific information like usernames, display names, groups, and sites is hidden in usage reports. To learn how to display this information in usage reports, see [Show user, group, or site details in usage reports](activity-reports.md#show-user-group-or-site-details-in-usage-reports).
