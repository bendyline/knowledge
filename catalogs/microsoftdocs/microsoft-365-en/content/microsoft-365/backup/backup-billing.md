# Departmental Billing for Microsoft 365 Backup 

If you're a large organization with multiple departments and want to manage Microsoft 365 Backup within departments or groups, departmental billing may be the right fit for you. With Departmental billing, you can manage Backup with the following features: 

1. Breakdown backup costs by different azure subscriptions.
2. Limit Backup management (creation and update) to certain admins within departments with Role-based-access-control(RBAC).
3. Prevent admins from another department using your azure subscription to cause unapproved backup charges.


**Role-Based-Access-Control within departments(RBAC)**: To limit admins who can manage Backup within a department or group, every backup admin should also have an Owner or Contributor role on the subscription. This way only an approved admin who is given spending power on a subscription can create and edit backups and cause consumption to the department's azure subscription. If you're an owner for the department's subscription, we recommend giving the lower privileged 'Contributor' role to backup admins in your department if they don't need privileges to add other admins to the subscription. 

### Set up departmental billing

To set up departmental billing for your tenant, follow these steps. 

1. Create billing policies and connect them to Microsoft 365 Backup following the instructions in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/commerce/services/pay-as-you-go-setup-billing-node" target="_blank"></a>**Pay-as-you-go Setup**</a> for Microsoft 365 Backup.
2. In the **Services** tab of **Pay-as-you-go** page, select **Microsoft 365 Backup**.
3. To enable departmental billing, in the **Settings** tab of Microsoft 365 Backup page, select the checkbox for limiting management of Backup within departments.

    Now that departmental billing with Backup is enabled for your tenant, Admins are assigned Owner / Contributor Azure roles to the billing policies connected to Backup can only create and edit backup policies.
   
5. You can create backup for your department by creating <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/backup/backup-setup?view=o365-worldwide#2-create-backup-policies-to-protect-your-data" target="_blank"></a>**backup policies as outlined here**</a>.
   In Create / Edit policy wizard, admins need to associate a Billing Policy with a Backup Policy. In the billing policy list, admins are shown only billing policies that they have Owner/Contributor access.

> **Note:**
> **Once you have enabled departmental billing, admins who have been assigned Owner / Contributor Azure roles to the billing policies connected to Backup can only create and edit backup policies.**

Admins who don't have RBAC rights to your backup policies will not be able to use your billing policy to create backup policies or edit backup policies created by admins in your department. Billing policies show as **Confidential** for admins who don't have access.

  1. Select the Backup policy you want to update the Billing Policy. Click on the 3-dots next to backup policy name and select **Update Billing policy**.

### Billing attribution by tenants, service type, and applications

You can see actual cost breakdown by tags in Azure portal. There are currently three tags available for Microsoft 365 Backup: **tenants**, **servicetype** and **protectionunitid**.

To view tags:

1. Select **+Add Filter** to see breakdown of cost by meters and tags.

2. Select the tag:

    - In the key-value pair, select **tenants** or **servicetype**, and then select the respective tenant ID or service type.

        - **tenants** shows a list of tenant IDs.

        - **servicetype** is OneDrive, SharePoint, or Exchange.

        - **applications** shows a list of app IDs.
     
        - **protectionunitid** shows a list of Site IDs.

        - SharePoint site - SiteId of the corresponding SharePoint site.

    - Azure cost analysis - filter by tag.
    
    - The tag for OneDrive is its siteID. To convert this back to a userID, you can use the following API: `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/<siteid>/drive?select=owner`

    We recommend using this view to see the costs by resources for Microsoft 365 Backup.
