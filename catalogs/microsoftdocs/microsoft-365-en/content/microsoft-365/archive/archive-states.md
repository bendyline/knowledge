# Archive states in Microsoft 365 Archive

The following table describes the archive states and allowed operations. These states apply to both archived files and archived sites.

| Archive state | Description | Allowed operations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recently archived | This state is the first stage after a site or file is archived and lasts for seven days. During this stage, reactivations are instantaneous. | Reactivate, Delete |
| Archived | A site or file enters this state seven days after it is archived. In this stage, reactivations can take up to 24 hours. | Reactivate, Delete |
| Reactivating | If a site or file is reactivated from the "*Archived*" state, it remains in this stage until reactivation completes. After reactivation, the content becomes active. When a site finishes reactivation, it appears on the Active sites page. Files that are reactivating remain in the same location after reactivation completes. | None for sites. Delete for files. |
