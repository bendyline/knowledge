# Set availability of Copilot Studio agents

You can assign and unassign individual agents to users and groups within your organization. However, before you assign an agent, the available users and groups must be available within your tenant.

There are two different actions that involve assigning agents to members of your organization:

- **Available to**: Allows you to select members of your organization that can find and install an agent.
- **Deployed to**: Allows you to deploy an agent to members of your organization, or just yourself.

> **Note:**
> Before you assign an agent to users or groups, review the agent’s capabilities, knowledge, and actions. Also, consider the agent’s security and compliance. For more information, see [Review available agents](../m365-agents-admin-guide.md#review-available-agents).

To view details about an individual agent:

1. Open the Copilot Control System within [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) in your browser.
2. Select **Agents** > **All agents**.
    You’ll see the **Agent inventory** tab is selected.
3. Select an agent from the list.
4. Select the **Users** tab and select **Assign to**. 
5. Select to assign the agent based on one of the options:
    a. Just me
    b. Entire organization
    c. Specific users/groups
6. Confirm who in your organization can install the agent by selecting **Available to**.
