# Agents FAQ for Microsoft 365

## Do I need an agent or a connector? How do I get started?

Whether you need an agent or a connector depends on your business needs. Agents in Microsoft 365 support specialized workflows and experiences, whereas connectors help add knowledge to Microsoft 365 intelligence experiences, including Copilot.

- **Agents in Microsoft 365** extend the functionality of Copilot by acting as specialized AI assistants tailored to specific domains or use cases. You can use agents to extend Copilot's knowledge, automate workflows, and deliver tailored user experiences in Microsoft Teams, Outlook, SharePoint, or custom apps. You can create a declarative agent using Copilot's AI infrastructure, model, and orchestrator. Or, for complex workflows or specific language models, you can create a custom agent. For more information, see [Agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/agents-overview).
- **Copilot connectors** enable you to ingest data, such as unstructured, line-of-business data, into the Microsoft Graph so that Copilot can reason over that data alongside other data. There are more than 100 prebuilt Copilot connectors available, and the Connectors API can be used to create custom connectors. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Copilot Connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-copilot-connector).

To get started, [review our planning guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/planning-guide), which can help you define your business need, and determine whether you need an agent or a connector. Also see [Understand available agent options](m365-agents-admin-guide.md#understand-available-agent-options).

## What kinds of agents are available for Microsoft 365?

There are two main types of agents you can create for Microsoft 365: 

- **[Declarative agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/agents-overview#declarative-agents)**, which use Copilot's AI infrastructure, model, and orchestrator. These agents are built using low-code tools like Agent Builder or pro-code tools like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit. Declarative agents run in Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, Outlook, and SharePoint.
- **[Custom engine agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/agents-overview#custom-engine-agents)**, which are fully customized AI assistants. These agents require hosting outside of Microsoft 365, and are typically built using low-code Copilot Studio or pro-code tools like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, and Agents Toolkit, using languages such as .NET, Python, and JavaScript, and frameworks like Semantic Kernel or LangChain.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Choose what type of agent to build](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/agents-overview#choose-what-type-of-agent-to-build)
- [Understand available agent options](m365-agents-admin-guide.md#understand-available-agent-options)

## Who can create, build, and share agents?

- **Users** can create declarative agents in Agent Builder or SharePoint if enabled by tenant settings (requires Copilot license or subscription)
- **Makers** can use Copilot Studio (lite or full) for low-code agents
- **Developers** can use Copilot Studio SDK or Agents Toolkit for pro-code agents. Developers can also [submit agents to the marketplace](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/agent-essentials/agent-policies/agent-submit-marketplace)
- Both **Makers** and **Developers** can add actions, connectors, and advanced logic in Copilot Studio or via the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit

People in your organization can also [sideload agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/agent-essentials/agent-policies/agent-sideload), [share agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-shared-agents), and [publish agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/agent-registry#publish-agents), according to tenant policies and admin controls that are configured in the Microsoft 365 admin center. 

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Agents admin guide for Microsoft 365](m365-agents-admin-guide.md)
- [Manage access to agents in Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps#manage-access-to-copilot-agents)

## What tools do I need to create, build, implement, and use agents in Microsoft 365?

Depending on what you want to do, Copilot agent tools are available, as summarized in the following table:

| Scenario | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| Use out-of-the-box Copilot capabilities | **Copilot in Microsoft 365 apps** (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams) |
| Build low-code declarative agents | **Copilot Studio** (lite or full) |
| Build pro-code declarative or custom agents | **Teams Toolkit** or **Microsoft 365 Agents SDK** |
| Administer and govern agents | **Microsoft 365 Admin Center** and **Copilot Control System** |

- [Planning guide for Copilot extensibility options](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/planning-guide)

## What governance or controls are available for agents?

The following governance options are available for agents in Microsoft 365:

- **[Copilot Control System](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/copilot-control-system/overview)**: Unified dashboard for managing Copilot and agents
- **[Microsoft Purview](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/ai-microsoft-purview)**: Compliance, audit, and eDiscovery across all extensibility options
- **Admin Centers**: [Microsoft 365 Admin Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/admin-overview/admin-center-overview) and [Power Platform Admin Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/admin-overview/admin-center-overview) for configuration and enforcement.

See [Understand agent security, privacy, and compliance](m365-agents-admin-guide.md#understand-agent-security-privacy-and-compliance).

## Can administrators monitor Copilot agent usage? 

Yes. Reports are available to help administrators monitor licenses, agents, and deployments. Custom reports can also be created. See [Copilot Control System measurement and reporting](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/copilot-control-system/security-governance).

## Can administrators control data sources used by agents and connectors?

Yes, administrators can control data sources that are used. Administrators can also configure Copilot features, specify sharing permissions, block or unblock agents, and more.

- Administrators can use **Copilot Control System** for agents and **Power Platform Admin Center** for connectors
- **Microsoft Purview** provides unified audit and compliance across all extensibility options
- Inventory and lifecycle controls help manage shared or ownerless agents

For more information, see the following resources:

- [Manage agents in Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-copilot-agents-integrated-apps)
- [Connectors overview in Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-copilot-connector)

## How does an agent access data?  

Agents run under an identity, whether it's the user's identity or a managed identity (or service principal) associated with the agent for autonomous tasks. Data access is enforced by organizational security. An agent can use APIs or connectors according to existing permissions assigned. 

Role-based access control (RBAC) is part of the enforcement model. Administrators can restrict agent creation and usage in the Copilot Control System and enforce RBAC policies across environments.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Copilot Control System security and governance](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/copilot-control-system/security-governance)
- [Understand agent security, privacy, and compliance](m365-agents-admin-guide.md#understand-agent-security-privacy-and-compliance)

## How should administrators control agents?

In general, administrators should take the following actions:

- Use the [Copilot Control System](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/copilot-control-system/overview) for centralized governance, security, and measurement
- Use [Purview DSPM for AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/dspm-for-ai?tabs=m365) to identify and mitigate oversharing and insider risks
- Configure [agent settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-app-admin-settings) for extensibility enablement and granular controls
