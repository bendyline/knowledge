# Microsoft 365 Copilot overview

> **Note:**
> Microsoft onboarded Anthropic as a Microsoft subprocessor. As a subprocessor, Anthropic operates with [Microsoft Enterprise data protections](enterprise-data-protection.md). For more information, see [Anthropic as a subprocessor for Microsoft Online Services](connect-to-ai-subprocessor.md).

**Microsoft 365 Copilot is an AI-powered tool that helps with your work tasks**.

Users enter a prompt in Copilot and Copilot responds with AI-generated information. The responses are in real-time and can include internet-based content and work content that users have permission to access.

Users get content relevant to their work tasks, and in the context of the Microsoft 365 app they're using.

The following video provides an overview of Microsoft 365 Copilot. It's 1 minute and 49 seconds long.

## Using Microsoft 365 Copilot

Say, for example, you're an operations manager and are working with human resources to update job descriptions. By providing Copilot the basic job requirements, you can ask Copilot to create a job description. You can also have Copilot add various job requirements and qualifications that should be included in the description. In the same prompting session, you can expand the generated job description to create different levels, like Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.

You can also [create and use agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility) to customize your Copilot experience with your organization's data sources. For example, say you're a warehouse manager and you need to know the status of a shipment. You can ask your Copilot shipping agent "What is the status of shipment 1234?" Copilot uses your data sources to get the information and can respond with the status.

This article is for IT admins. It describes the different components that Microsoft 365 Copilot uses and the Copilot features in the Microsoft 365 apps. Learn more about the [Microsoft 365 Copilot architecture and how it works](microsoft-365-copilot-architecture.md).

## Differences between Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Chat

Microsoft 365 Copilot uses your organizational data and the web. It requires an [add-on license](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-licensing). Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat uses the web and users can provide organizational data. It doesn't require an additional license.

## The technical details

Diagram that shows the Microsoft 365 tenant architecture with Microsoft 365 Copilot and your user data.

Microsoft 365 Copilot:

- Pairs with the Microsoft 365 productivity apps that you use every day, like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and others. For example, you can use Copilot in Word to help create a document, in Excel to get suggestions for formulas, in Outlook to summarize an email thread, and in Teams to summarize meetings.

- Uses content in [Microsoft Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/overview) to personalize the responses with a user's work emails, chats, and documents. Copilot only shows the data that users have permission to access.

- Includes [Microsoft 365 Copilot Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-search), a universal search experience that allows users to search across all their Microsoft 365 and third-party data sources to find what they need quickly.

- Coordinates large language models (LLMs). LLMs are artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. These algorithms use deep learning techniques and data sets to understand, summarize, predict, and generate content.

| **Teams** | **Chat**—Copilot can summarize up to 30 days of the chat content before the last message in a chat. <br/><br/>Copilot uses only the single chat thread as source content for responses. It can't reference other chats or data types, like meeting transcripts, emails, and files. Users can select prewritten prompts or write their own questions. Responses include clickable citations that direct users to the relevant source content that was used. <br/><br/> Conversations with Copilot take place in a side panel and allows users to copy and paste. Copilot conversations close when the side panel closes. <br/><br/> **Meetings**—Users can invoke Copilot in meetings or calls within the same tenant. Copilot uses the transcript in real-time to answer questions from the user. It only uses the transcript and knows the name of the user typing the question. <br/><br/> Users can type any question or use predetermined prompts. Copilot answers questions only related to the meeting conversation from the transcript. The user can copy/paste an answer and access Copilot after the meeting ends. <br/><br/> **Copilot**—Users access data across their Microsoft 365 Graph and use LLM functionality. <br/><br/> **Calls**—Automates important administrative tasks of a call, like capturing key points, task owners, and next steps. It supports voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and public switched telephone network (PSTN) calls. |
| **Whiteboard** | **Draft**—Use natural language to generate ideas, organize ideas into themes, create designs based on ideas, and summarize whiteboard content. |

## Microsoft 365 services that help support Copilot

Diagram that shows services and features that help you get your data and organization ready for Copilot.

Your Microsoft 365 license includes services and features that help you get your data and organization ready for Copilot.

- **SharePoint Advanced Management (SAM)**

  Microsoft SharePoint Premium – SharePoint Advanced Management (SAM) helps you reduce oversharing and cleanup inactive sites. These tasks declutter Copilot's data sources and improve the quality of the responses.

  To learn more, see [Get ready for Microsoft 365 Copilot with SharePoint Advanced Management (SAM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/get-ready-copilot-sharepoint-advanced-management).

- **Restricted SharePoint Search**

  Restricted SharePoint Search (RSS) gives you time to review and configure the correct permissions on your SharePoint sites. You add the reviewed and corrected sites to an allowed list that Copilot can access.

  For more information, see [Restricted SharePoint Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/restricted-sharepoint-search).

- **Microsoft Purview**

  Microsoft Purview can classify and label your data based on the sensitivity of the content. It can also help prevent unauthorized sharing or leakage and review Copilot prompts and responses.

  For more information, see [Microsoft Purview data security and compliance protections for generative AI apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/ai-microsoft-purview).

- **Microsoft Agents**

  Agents are scoped or focused versions of Microsoft 365 Copilot that act as AI assistants and can automate business processes. For example, you can create an agent that creates help desk tickets, or a human resources agent that looks up employee info from your data source.

  For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Copilot extensibility overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility).
