# Microsoft 365 Copilot workflows environment for Workflows agents

The *Microsoft 365 Copilot workflows environment* is a special purpose Power Platform environment. When users in your tenant first use Workflows agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot, Power Platform automatically creates it. This environment supports runtime operations required by Workflows agents. It is created and governed differently than typical environments.

This article provides details about the environment's characteristics, behavior, permissions, and limitations. As a Power Platform or Microsoft 365 administrator, it can help you understand and manage the environment appropriately.

## Environment provisioning

When a user with a Copilot license uses Workflows agents for the first time, Power Platform automatically creates the *Microsoft 365 Copilot workflows* environment. It creates the environment, with Dataverse, in the region in or closest to the default region of your organization's Microsoft Entra tenant.

You don't need to take any manual steps to create this environment. It only creates one environment per tenant. The environment isn't visible in the Power Platform admin center environment list, or any Maker portals. Only *Workflows agents* workflows created in Microsoft 365 Copilot are stored in this environment, which are viewable in Power Platform admin center inventory for tenant admins to view.

The environment isn't deletable once created. However, since the environment's sole purpose is to house Workflows agents created in the tenant, the environment and flows created within are auto disabled and locked down in this instance: if a tenant admin disables Workflows agents from Microsoft 365 admin center.

## App and connection usage

Power Platform creates a security role for the environment named **M365 Workflows Agents Maker.** It also assigns this role to the users in the tenant, which provides users with permission to use Workflows agents and save in the environment.

> **Note:**
> By default, users aren't given **Environment Maker** permissions.

Users don't have direct access to create any artifact other than flows from Workflows agents, as the environment is hidden from all Maker portals.

## Data loss prevention (DLP)

The Microsoft 365 Copilot workflows environment has a fixed data loss prevention (DLP) policy:

All connectors are blocked, except for a set of connectors used by *Workflows agents* that include:

- Microsoft Teams
- Outlook (Office 365 Outlook)
- Planner
- Approvals
- SharePoint
- AI action, AI prompt

This environment limits the use to the previous set of allowlisted connectors only in the context of flows created from Workflows agents.

> **Important:**
> Tenant-level and environment-level DLP policies don't apply to the **Microsoft 365 Copilot Workflows** environment. Tenant admins have environment admin privileges to this environment to perform DSR export and delete.

## Frequently asked questions

This section contains answer to frequently asked questions about the Workflows environment.

### What triggers the creation of the Microsoft 365 environment?

Power Platform creates the environment when a Copilot-licensed user in the tenant uses Workflows agents for the first time.

### What license or app does the user require?

The user must be assigned a Microsoft 365 Copilot license with the Microsoft Copilot with Graph-grounded chat app for the user to be provisioned in the environment.

### Can I delete the Microsoft 365 Copilot workflows environment?

No.

### Does this environment consume storage from my tenant's entitlement?

No. For storage that this environment uses, Power Platform excludes it from your tenant's capacity calculations. It also doesn't appear on capacity pages.

### Can I apply custom DLP policies to this environment?

No. Power Platform governs this environment with a fixed DLP policy. Tenant or environment-level policies don't apply to this environment.

### Can users create custom apps, flows, or bots in this environment?

No. In the environment, Power Platform limits to only flows created from *Workflows agents* and with the set of allowlisted connectors.
