# Extend Employee Self-Service agent: Register a Vehicle

The Employee Self-Service Copilot agent allows employees to get their queries answered from admin-configured knowledge sources, HCM, and IT systems, directly within Microsoft 365 Copilot.

An organization may seek to enhance Employee Self-Service Copilot agent by integrating additional capabilities. These additional capabilities enable organizations to maximize the benefits of Employee Self-Service and support work-related activities.

To support these needs, Employee Self-Service Copilot agent is designed to be extensible. You can create and publish your own topics that work seamlessly alongside the built-in ones. This article explains the steps to extend Employee Self-Service by adding new topics tailored to your organization.

At Microsoft, we extended Employee Self-Service Copilot agent to bring in Real Estate and Facilities related experiences. Some scenarios that this extensibility to Employee Self-Service is helping us power are:

- Create a Facilities Ticket (Facilities), for example, "I want to report a water leak."
- Register a Vehicle (Parking), for example, "I want to register my vehicle Tesla Model 3."
- View food stations or counters by cuisine (Dining), for example, "Where can I find Chinese food?"
- Invite a Guest (Lobby), for example, "I want to invite my spouse to Building 32."

The following section shows how a maker in Copilot Studio can extend Employee Self-Service to support these scenarios. Before diving into the maker experience, it's important to understand what real estate and facilities are and how they support employees.

## Real Estate & Facilities

Real Estate and Facilities (RE&F) play a pivotal role in shaping the overall employee experience within an organization. By integrating RE&F services into Employee Self-Service platforms, companies can streamline access to essential workplace amenities and administrative tasks, making daily operations more efficient and user-friendly for employees.

For instance, features like - vehicle registration, facilities tickets for maintenance requests, access to café menus, and streamlined guest invitation processes empower employees to manage their work environment proactively. These capabilities reduce administrative overhead, minimize wait times, and improve satisfaction by giving employees greater control and visibility over their workplace needs.

Moreover, such integrated experiences foster a sense of belonging and engagement, as employees feel supported by systems that anticipate and address their requirements. These integrated experiences not only enhance productivity, but also contribute to a positive organizational culture where employees can focus more on their core responsibilities rather than logistical hassles.

Ultimately, the seamless blend of real estate and facilities management with employee-centric digital solutions helps organizations attract, retain, and motivate talent by prioritizing their day-to-day comfort and efficiency.

Now that we covered the fundamentals, let’s walk through a practical example. In the following sections, we extend the Employee Self-Service Copilot agent to allow employees to perform various operations.

## Prerequisites

To extend the Employee Self-Service Copilot agent with a custom *Register a Vehicle* topic, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Employee Self-Service agent is installed in Copilot Studio.
- Access to [Copilot Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/CopilotStudioSamples/tree/main/EmployeeSelfServiceAgent/Facilities/EmployeeRegisterVehicle) in GitHub.
- Maker access to a sandbox or preproduction environment in Copilot Studio.
- Access to the Vehicle Registration API and Config APIs, which are used to fetch the config data for different regions.
  - For this example of registering a vehicle for parking on campus, we assume the vehicle registration system is a custom solution built on the Azure platform.

## Fundamentals

Extending Employee Self-Service for RE&F experiences requires an understanding of a few key building blocks: **topics, adaptive cards, and connectors**. Together, these building blocks define how conversational scenarios are designed and how they interact with RE&F services.

### Topics

In Copilot Studio, a topic is defined as a workflow of a conversation. Microsoft 365 Copilot topics are used to:

- Define trigger prompts that determine when the *Register a Vehicle* topic should be activated based on user’s natural language input.
- Present a vehicle registration form where users can fill in required details.
- Trigger an HTTP API call to the backend vehicle registration APIs.
- Interpret the backend API response and return the relevant outcome to the user in natural language.

### Adaptive Cards

Adaptive cards are platform-agnostic UI snippets authored in JSON. They help create interactive and visually appealing cards to capture user inputs while maintaining the conversational flow.

### Connectors

Connectors enable you to connect the agent with other apps, data, and devices in the cloud.

For this example of registering a vehicle for parking on campus, we assume the vehicle registration system is a custom solution built on Azure. The HTTP connector is used to connect to backend APIs for registering a vehicle.

## Example: Register Your Vehicle for Parking

In the **Register Your Vehicle for Parking** scenario, an employee can register their vehicle for parking on campus by providing necessary details such as vehicle make, model, license plate number, and parking duration. The Employee Self-Service Copilot agent processes this information, interacts with the backend parking management system, and confirms the registration status to the employee.

This process involves only one step:

- **Creating a topic**: Define the workflow, trigger prompts, and instructions for the vehicle registration scenario.
  - Design an Adaptive card to capture vehicle details, and to build binding inputs to state variables for API requests.
  - Validate API responses, handle errors as required, and provide user feedback.

### Create a Topic

- Create a topic named **Register a Vehicle**
  - In Copilot Studio, select **Add a topic > From blank**.
  - Once inside the topic, select **Open code editor**.
  - Use the code from the Copilot Samples repository [Register your Vehicle topic YAML](https://github.com/microsoft/CopilotStudioSamples/blob/main/EmployeeSelfServiceAgent/Facilities/EmployeeRegisterVehicle/topic.yaml) and paste in the code editor.
  - Update the HTTP API URL in the code sample. Search for "kind: HttpRequestAction" and update the URL property as per your backend system.
  - Save the topic.

- Validate
  - Open the visual representation of the topic definition and validate the workflow of the topic.
  - Select **Topic Checker** for any static issues with the definition.
  - Optionally, go through the following section, "Review the topic workflow", to understand and validate the steps.

- Now, let's test the newly added topic
  - Using the Test button in **Copilot Studio**, open the test chat window.
  - Register a vehicle using the prompt "I want to register my vehicle for parking". This prompt opens an Adaptive card where you can fill the required details like vehicle type, vehicle make and model, license plate number, etc.
  - Upon successful submission, the Employee Self-Service system displays a confirmation that the vehicle is registered.
  
### Review the topic workflow

- The Trigger node captures the topic description, which is visible from the user interface. You can use Microsoft 365 copilot to fine-tune as per your requirements.

- The next few nodes take care of extracting and assigning correct CountryCode to each request.
  - This configuration is an optional step. To correctly extract and validate the CountryCode, few variables are maintained. These variables are then used in a group of conditional statements to make the required configuration.
  - If CountryCode configuration isn't required, remove these nodes by deleting the corresponding variables and condition nodes.

- The next node is to make an HTTP call to the backend Config API to fetch all Country Specific configuration. We use HttpRequestAction component for making the HTTP call. The HTTP call can be alternatively configured in several other ways described in the connectors section previously.
  - The next set of nodes are conditional statements, which parse the data received from config API call. This parsed config data is stored into different set of properties. We store information like registration type options, vehicle type options, vehicle color options, etc. These options are prepopulated in the vehicle registration form that gets rendered in the following steps.
- The next node is the vehicle registration adaptive card with action buttons. Verify the existing fields. Currently the required input parameters for creating a vehicle registration are - vehicle type,  make, model, year of manufacturing, color, license plate number, state, parking location, and registration type. Users can add or modify fields as needed.
  - Different adaptive cards are configured to capture different set of required inputs based on the CountryCode value.

- The next node is to make an HTTP call to the backend vehicle registration API with all the collected information forwarded with the request.
- The following steps determine if the vehicle registration was successful and displays a message to the user accordingly.
  - Upon successful submission, the Employee Self-Service system displays a confirmation of the registration for the user’s vehicle.
  - In case the request failed due to any reason, a failure message is sent to the user. These messages can be customized by modifying the corresponding SendActivity components.

## FAQs

### I need to configure the API call as per my requirement. What should I do?

We use *HttpRequestAction* component for making the HTTP calls. As a start, you can use the same and modify it as per your needs. There are also several other ways to configure the HTTP call as described in the connectors section previously.

- Expand the HttpRequestAction node, and in the URL section select **Select variable** > **Formula** to update your backend API URL. Select **Insert** to save the URL.

- Select the appropriate Response data type as per your backend contracts from the dropdown.
- Save the response in a state variable. This state variable allows you to access the response in the later steps.

### How are error conditions handled?

Towards the end of the topic, you see conditional branching as shown in the following image, which is used to handle errors and send the appropriate messages to the user. These conditions can be customized, and any additional conditions can be added to the same condition group as required.

### What should I do if I get an error message?

Depending on the error message, check the following nodes:

- **API configuration**: Ensure the HTTP API URL in your topic definition is correct and points to the intended backend system. Double-check for typos or outdated endpoints.
- **Request method**: Verify that the HTTP request method (GET, POST, PUT) matches the expected operation for your backend API.
- **Headers and body**: Confirm that all required headers (for example, authentication scope, content type) and request body parameters are correctly set as per your backend API specification.
- **Response data type**: Make sure the response data type in your topic matches what your backend API returns (for example, Record, Table, String).
- **State variables**: Check that responses from API calls are being saved to the correct state variables for use in subsequent steps.
- **Error handling logic**: Review the conditional nodes at the end of your topic to ensure error conditions are properly handled and user-friendly messages are displayed.

### The vehicle registration form isn't showing the list of options. Why?

- Confirm that the API call to fetch config data is correctly configured and the response is being parsed and saved to the appropriate variables.
- Check for any changes in the backend API contract or endpoint.

### My API call returns a blank or unexpected response. What could be wrong?

- Validate the request headers and body parameters.
- Validate the response data type and ensure it matches the backend API output.
- Validate the backend API logs and check for errors or contract mismatches.

### Additional tips

- Before testing, to identify static issues in your topic definition, use the Topic Checker in Copilot Studio.
- Test your topic using the built-in chat window and review the workflow visually to catch any misconfigurations early.
