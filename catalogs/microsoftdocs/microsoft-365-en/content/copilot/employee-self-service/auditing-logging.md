# Auditing and logging

The Employee Self-Service agent is built on Copilot and Power Platform. You can use auditing capabilities from these platforms to log and monitor usage.

### Audit with Microsoft Purview

Microsoft Purview provides features for a comprehensive audit record of end-user activities when interacting with agents.
