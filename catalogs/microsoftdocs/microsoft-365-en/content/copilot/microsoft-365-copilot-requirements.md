# Microsoft 365 app and network requirements for Microsoft 365 Copilot

[Microsoft 365 Copilot](microsoft-365-copilot-overview.md) is an AI-powered productivity tool that integrates with Microsoft 365 Apps. This integration allows users to use Copilot in individual apps, such as Word, PowerPoint, Teams, Excel, Outlook, and more. The Copilot experiences are designed to provide users with an AI assistant in the apps they use every day.

As a result of this integration, there are some app and network requirements for Microsoft 365 Copilot to integrate with your Microsoft 365 apps. These requirements are nearly identical to the requirements for using Microsoft 365 Apps.

As part of your [Microsoft 365 Copilot adoption](microsoft-365-copilot-enablement-resources.md), make sure you configure the app and network requirements that allow the app integration.

## Review app privacy

Review your Microsoft 365 apps privacy settings. The privacy settings in your Microsoft 365 apps can affect the availability of Microsoft 365 Copilot features. To ensure that users can access Copilot features, review the privacy settings in your Microsoft 365 apps.

To learn more, see [Microsoft 365 Copilot and privacy controls for connected experiences](microsoft-365-copilot-privacy.md#microsoft-365-copilot-and-privacy-controls-for-connected-experiences).

## Run the Office Feature Updates task

The Office Feature Updates task is required for core Copilot experiences in apps such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and OneNote, to work properly. This task should be allowed to run on its regular schedule, and allowed to access the required network resources.

For more information about the Office Feature Updates task, see [Office Feature Updates task description and FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/troubleshoot/updates/office-feature-updates-task-faq).

For more information about the network resources that should be allowed, see [Network requirements](#network-requirements) (in this article).

## Network requirements

Configure your network for Microsoft 365 Copilot. Copilot experiences are deeply integrated with Microsoft 365 applications and often use the same [network connections and endpoints that Microsoft 365 apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges) use.

Baseline network configuration customers should:

- Make sure that the Microsoft 365 endpoints listed in this section aren't blocked within their environment.
- Verify that their network setup follows [Microsoft 365 network connectivity principles and best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-network-connectivity-principles).

✅ **Network endpoint requirements**:

- Allow the [worldwide Microsoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges).

✅ **WebSockets (WSS) protocol requirements**:

Verify that your network supports full WSS connectivity from user devices running Microsoft 365 applications to the following domains:

- Microsoft 365 Copilot enterprise experiences: `*.cloud.microsoft`, `*.office.com`

Several Copilot integrations rely on WebSockets (WSS) to deliver a streamlined user experience. Some customer networks might not be configured to handle WSS connections properly, which can result in Copilot application failures. Typical network configurations that affect WSS include:

- The network perimeter blocks the WSS protocol
- Network devices attempting to perform Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection of connections
- Proxy servers enforcing aggressive connection timeouts

✅ **FQDNs and subdomains**:

Some organization might prefer to use granular definitions of endpoints, like individual FQDNs, instead of wildcards to configure their network settings. Due to hyperscale and the dynamic nature of its services, Microsoft 365 can't provide specific FQDNs used by individual features and scenarios. Doing so would result in unmanageable configuration surface, constant customer network changes, and connectivity incidents.

When you review and implement the recommended network configurations, consider all the FQDNs and subdomains where wildcards are specified. These wildcards include functionality that the referenced scenarios require.

✅ **cloud.microsoft domain**:

Microsoft plans to consolidate Copilot experiences for Microsoft 365 under the `*.cloud.microsoft` domain. And, Copilot network requirements and associated required customer network configurations can be further simplified.

For more information, see [Unified cloud.microsoft domain for Microsoft 365 apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/enterprise/cloud-microsoft-domain).
