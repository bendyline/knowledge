# Which Copilot is right for me or my organization?

Copilot is Microsoft's AI-powered virtual assistant. It uses large language models (LLMs) to answer your questions using a prompt-and-response interaction.

Microsoft 365 offers two variants based on licensing. The following image highlights their key differences:

A graphic that illustrates key capability differences between Copilot offered in Microsoft 365 licensing and the dedicated Microsoft 365 Copilot add on license.

**If you're an admin**, this article describes the different Copilots and can help you decide which Copilots are right for your organization.

**If you're an end user**, have a Copilot installed, and not sure what Copilot you have, then this article can help you understand the Copilot that's installed on your device.
