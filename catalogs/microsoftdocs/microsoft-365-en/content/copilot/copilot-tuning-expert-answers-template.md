# Copilot Tuning Expert Answers agent template (early access preview)

The **Expert Answers** agent template is a tunable Microsoft 365 Copilot agent template designed to answer complex, domain-specific questions grounded in your organization's content. You can further tune the agent by using enterprise data to improve answer quality, relevance, and consistency.

This article describes common scenarios, tuning options, requirements, and limitations to help you implement the Expert Answers agent template effectively.

> **Important:**
> Microsoft 365 Copilot Tuning is currently available to a limited set of customers through early access programs. Access through [Frontier](https://adoption.microsoft.com/copilot/frontier-program/) is planned for April 2026. Features and requirements are subject to change.


## Expert Answers agent template overview

The Expert Answers agent template performs deep searches across your enterprise content and generates grounded answers based on that data.

Common scenarios include:

- Question answering over large grounding datasets, such as legal or compliance repositories with thousands of files
- Enforcing specific tone or guardrails, such as for internal HR or policy agents
- Working with datasets that contain company-specific terminology or jargon, such as internal knowledge bases

A typical workflow starts with testing the non-customized agent. You can then customize the agent by using the **Expert Answers agent template** in Agent Builder, and optionally tune the agent to further improve its responses.

Final responses combine:

- Declarative agent capabilities configured in Agent Builder
- Expert Answers capabilities configured through the tuning flow

In most cases, use both approaches together by adding knowledge in Agent Builder and refining behavior through agent tuning.

## Tuning flow

Tuning flow helps you evaluate and improve agent responses. You can tune an Expert Answers agent template in three ways.

| Tuning type | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| **Context** | Add Expert Answers search capabilities in addition to declarative agent features, and evaluate agent behavior |
| **Model** | Improve how the agent searches and retrieves relevant files |
| **Tools** | Add sub-agents to enforce guardrails, apply tone, or generate deeper responses by using Researcher |

## Use the non-customized agent

Before customizing the agent, test the default experience.

You must select a SharePoint site before asking a question. The agent answers questions by using content from that site. If you don't select a site, the agent searches previous messages for a referenced site.

## Customize the agent

Start by selecting the **Expert Answers agent template** in Agent Builder.

Provide the following information:

- **Name**
- **Description**
- **Instructions**

You can optionally add **knowledge** and **capabilities**.

### Use the customized agent

After customization, the agent answers questions using the SharePoint sites you configured as knowledge sources.

## Context tuning

By using context tuning, you can set the agent's goals, create evaluation data, and enhance the Expert Answers search capability's information retrieval.

Provide the following information during this step:

| Information | Page | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main goal and domain | Define tuning goals | Guides search behavior and suggests subgoals and metrics |
| Example file upload | Define tuning goals | Creates evaluation data |
| Subgoals | Review clarifying questions | Guides search behavior and evaluation |
| Metrics | Review metrics | Evaluates agent responses |
| Grounding information | Agent context | Defines search behavior |

Screenshot that shows context tuning involves setting the agent's goals, creating evaluation data, and enhancing the Expert Answers search information retrieval.

### Define tuning goals

- **Main goal**: Refines the agent's objective. Use existing instructions as a starting point. The goal guides the Expert Answers search capability during inference.
- **Domain**: Specifies a high-level subject area, such as human resources.
- **Example files**: Sample files used to generate evaluation questions and answers. These files should represent the document types and topics users are likely to ask about.

Select these files from the grounding dataset. Providing more files (up to 50) and increasing topic diversity improves evaluation quality.

Screenshot showing the Define tuning goals page where you specify the main goal, domain, and upload example files for evaluation.

### Review clarifying questions

Use subgoals with your uploaded documents to generate question-and-answer pairs for evaluation. They also help guide the Expert Answers search capability.

Focus these questions on the types of queries users are expected to ask. Define answer-quality criteria in the metrics step.

### Review metrics

Define how to evaluate the agent. In addition to the metrics you specify, Microsoft applies a built-in accuracy metric that compares the agent's response with a "golden" answer derived from your data.

Screenshot showing the Review metrics page where you define evaluation criteria for agent responses.

### Agent context

Review the agent's grounding data. The Expert Answers search capability uses this data to generate responses.

## Evaluations

When you complete context tuning and the subsequent steps, the **Tune agent** homepage displays evaluation results.

## Model tuning

Model tuning trains the Expert Answers search capability. The agent uses a **training dataset** to learn how to write better queries and select more relevant documents from the **grounding dataset**.

Although the grounding dataset primarily generates final answers, information from the training dataset might also appear in responses. In most cases, use the same dataset for grounding and training.

Model tuning is most effective when:

- The grounding dataset contains several hundred or more files.
- Queries include company-specific language or concepts.

To tune a model:

1. **Provide preferred outputs:** Select a **training dataset**. In most scenarios, use the same dataset for grounding.

1. **Review access:** Review the access recommendations.

## Tool tuning

Tool tuning enables you to add extra tools that the agent can use when it generates responses. These tools include:

- **Style Editor (tunable agent)** to rewrite responses so they match a specific tone
- **Document Reviewer (tunable agent)** to enforce defined guardrails
- **Researcher** to perform longer, deeper searches

To use tunable agents, first context tune them.

You can also provide orchestration instructions that define how tools work together. If you select all tools, the default flow is:

1. Use Researcher as an extra source.
2. Rewrite the response by using the Style Editor.
3. Validate the response by using the Document Reviewer.

Examples of custom orchestration instructions include:

- If the initial answer is incomplete, use Researcher before generating the final response.
- If the question is about benefits, use the validation agent.
- Use the validation agent first, then apply tone alignment.

## Limitations

### Context tuning

- Only SharePoint files and folders are supported.
- Expert Answers search has known retrieval limitations.

### Model tuning

- Only SharePoint files and folders are supported.
- Supported file types: .docx, .pdf, .aspx, .doc, .html, .txt.
- Only text content is used for training.
- For .aspx and .html files, only extracted text is used.

### Tool tuning

- If you add knowledge or capabilities in Agent Builder, responses might not follow the tone or guardrails defined by the Style Editor or Document Reviewer. This limitation occurs when you add extra information after these agents run.
- To ensure tone and rule enforcement, avoid adding capabilities in Agent Builder.

## FAQ

### What knowledge sources should I add in Agent Builder, context tuning, and model tuning?

In most cases, use the same knowledge source across all three. You might choose a different approach if:

- You don't want to use declarative agent capabilities. In this case, don't add knowledge in Agent Builder.
- You want the Expert Answers search capability to focus on a subset of files. In this case, limit the files added during context and model tuning.

### When should I retrain my agent?

Incremental changes to grounding data typically don't significantly reduce performance. New files are included in responses automatically. However, information from files removed after training might still appear in responses until you retrain the agent.
