## Compliance considerations

Prompt Gallery processes and manages data in a structured manner to ensure compliance and security. The following are key data compliance considerations:

1. Authenticated users can access Prompt Gallery from Microsoft 365 Copilot. Unauthenticated users can only see Microsoft-authored prompts online at [Copilot Prompts](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/copilot-prompts), however, users must authenticate to try any of them in Copilot.
1. Prompt Gallery accesses Microsoft-authored Copilot prompts from the public catalog.
1. Prompt Gallery also accesses user-created Copilot prompts from user and group collections in the Microsoft 365 Substrate data store.

The Copilot prompts are stored in collections within the Substrate Data Store, which is a storage type that allows applications to store files and data and enables efficient indexing and search. There are collections for users and groups, all of which are within the tenant boundary. All data is encrypted, transported via a secure pipeline, and is accessible only via Substrate APIs.
