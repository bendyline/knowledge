# Manage generative AI apps for your organization

As people embrace and incorporate [generative AI apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/ai/playbook/technology-guidance/generative-ai/), such as Microsoft 365 Copilot and non-Microsoft AI apps into daily work, it's important for your organization's security team to be able to manage those apps. Microsoft applies a multi-layered, defense-in-depth strategy to secure Microsoft 365 Copilot at every level (see [Security for Microsoft 365 Copilot](security-microsoft-365-copilot.md)). 

But what about non-Microsoft AI apps? 

Using capabilities in [Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/purview/dspm-for-ai?tabs=m365) (part of Microsoft Purview), [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-cloud-apps/what-is-defender-for-cloud-apps) (part of Microsoft Defender), and [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/concept-cloud-security-posture-management) for [AI security posture management](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/ai-security-posture) in [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction), your security team can empower people in your organization to use generative AI apps more securely, including both Microsoft and non-Microsoft AI apps.

This article describes how to:

- [Use DSPM for AI to discover and manage AI app usage](#use-dspm-for-ai-to-discover-and-manage-ai-app-usage); and 
- [Use Defender for Cloud Apps to discover, monitor, or block generative AI apps](#use-defender-for-cloud-apps-to-discover-monitor-or-block-generative-ai-apps); and
- [Use Defender for Cloud's CSPM to assess and manage AI security posture](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/ai-security-posture).
