# Scaling with Event Hubs

There are two factors that influence scaling with Event Hubs.

- Throughput units (standard tier) or processing units (premium tier) 
- Partitions

## Throughput units

Throughput units control the throughput capacity of event hubs. Throughput units are prepurchased units of capacity. A single throughput unit provides the following capabilities:

* Ingress: Up to 1 MB per second or 1,000 events per second (whichever comes first).
* Egress: Up to 2 MB per second or 4,096 events per second.

If you exceed the capacity of the throughput units you purchased, ingress is throttled and Event Hubs throws a [EventHubsException](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.messaging.eventhubs.eventhubsexception) with a Reason value of ServiceBusy. Egress doesn't produce throttling exceptions, but it still can't go beyond the capacity of the throughput units you purchased. If you receive publishing rate exceptions or expect to see higher egress, check how many throughput units you purchased for the namespace. You can manage throughput units on the **Scale** page of the namespaces in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). You can also manage throughput units programmatically by using the [Event Hubs APIs](event-hubs-samples.md).

You prepurchase throughput units and pay for them by the hour. Once you purchase throughput units, you pay for a minimum of one hour. You can purchase up to 40 throughput units for an Event Hubs namespace, and all event hubs in that namespace share these throughput units. All partitions and consumers within each event hub share the total ingress and egress capacity of these throughput units, so multiple consumers reading from the same partition share the available bandwidth.

The **Auto-inflate** feature of Event Hubs automatically scales up by increasing the number of throughput units to meet usage needs. Increasing throughput units prevents throttling scenarios, in which:

- Data ingress rates exceed set throughput units.
- Data egress request rates exceed set throughput units.

The Event Hubs service increases the throughput when load increases beyond the minimum threshold, without any requests failing with ServerBusy errors. 

For more information about the autoinflate feature, see [Automatically scale throughput units](event-hubs-auto-inflate.md).

## Processing units

 [Event Hubs Premium](event-hubs-premium-overview.md) provides superior performance and better isolation within a managed multitenant PaaS environment. The resources in a Premium tier are isolated at the CPU and memory level so that each tenant workload runs in isolation. This resource container is called a **Processing Unit** (PU). You can purchase 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 16 processing Units for each Event Hubs Premium namespace. 

How much you can ingest and stream with a processing unit depends on various factors such as your producers, consumers, the rate at which you're ingesting and processing, and much more. 

For example, Event Hubs Premium namespace with one PU and one event hub (100 partitions) can approximately offer core capacity of ~5-10 MB/s ingress and 10-20 MB/s egress for both AMQP or Kafka workloads.

For more information about configuring PUs for a premium tier namespace, see [Configure processing units](configure-processing-units-premium-namespace.md).

## Partitions

Event Hubs organizes sequences of events sent to an event hub into one or more partitions. As newer events arrive, they're added to the end of this sequence.

A partition can be thought of as a commit log. Partitions hold event data that contains the following information:

- Body of the event
- User-defined property bag describing the event
- Metadata such as its offset in the partition, its number in the stream sequence
- Service-side timestamp at which it was accepted

### Advantages of using partitions
Event Hubs is designed to help with processing of large volumes of events, and partitioning helps with that in two ways:

- Even though Event Hubs is a PaaS service, there's a physical reality underneath. Maintaining a log that preserves the order of events requires that these events are being kept together in the underlying storage and its replicas and that results in a throughput ceiling for such a log. Partitioning allows for multiple parallel logs to be used for the same event hub and therefore multiplying the available raw input-output (IO) throughput capacity.
- Your own applications must be able to keep up with processing the volume of events that are being sent into an event hub. It might be complex and requires substantial, scaled-out, parallel processing capacity. The capacity of a single process to handle events is limited, so you need several processes. Partitions are how your solution feeds those processes and yet ensures that each event has a clear processing owner. 

### Number of partitions
The number of partitions is specified at the time of creating an event hub. It must be between one and the maximum partition count allowed for each pricing tier. For the partition count limit for each tier, see [this article](event-hubs-quotas.md#basic-vs-standard-vs-premium-vs-dedicated-tiers). 

We recommend that you choose at least as many partitions as you expect that are required during the peak load of your application for that particular event hub.

For tiers other than the premium and dedicated tiers, you can't change the partition count for an event hub after its creation. For an event hub in a premium or dedicated tier, you can [increase the partition count](dynamically-add-partitions.md) after its creation, but you can't decrease them. The distribution of streams across partitions will change when it's done as the mapping of partition keys to partitions changes, so you should try hard to avoid such changes if the relative order of events matters in your application.

Setting the number of partitions to the maximum permitted value is tempting, but always keep in mind that your event streams need to be structured such that you can indeed take advantage of multiple partitions. If you need absolute order preservation across all events or only a handful of substreams, you might not be able to take advantage of many partitions. Also, many partitions make the processing side more complex. 

It doesn't matter how many partitions are in an event hub when it comes to pricing. It depends on the number of pricing units ([throughput units
(TUs)](event-hubs-scalability.md#throughput-units) for the standard tier, [processing units (PUs)](event-hubs-scalability.md#processing-units) for the premium tier, and [capacity units (CUs)](event-hubs-dedicated-overview.md#capacity-units) for the dedicated tier) for the namespace or the dedicated cluster. For example, an event hub of the standard tier with 32 partitions or with one partition incur the exact same cost when the namespace is set to one TU capacity. Also, you can scale TUs or PUs on your namespace or CUs of your dedicated cluster independent of the partition count. 


A [partition](event-hubs-features.md#partitions) is a data organization mechanism that enables parallel publishing and consumption. While it supports parallel processing and scaling, total capacity remains limited by the namespace's scaling allocation. Balance scaling units (throughput units for the standard tier, processing units for the premium tier, or capacity units for the dedicated tier) and partitions to achieve optimal scale.

Start with your workload profile: average payload size, events per second, and sensitivity to throughput drops or latency spikes. Use the per-partition throughput below as a starting point, then validate with load tests:

- **Standard tier**: ~1 MB/s ingress and ~2 MB/s egress per partition.
- **Premium and Dedicated tiers**: ~1-2 MB/s ingress and ~2-5 MB/s egress per partition.

Estimate partitions by dividing your expected ingress and egress by the applicable per-partition rates and taking the larger result. If observed throughput or latency doesn't meet expectations, increase partitions (Premium and Dedicated tiers only) and retest.

Partitions also set the ceiling for consumer parallelism. How that ceiling works depends on the consumer type:

- **Epoch (exclusive) consumers** — Used by `EventProcessorClient` (.NET, Java) and `EventHubConsumerClient` (Python, JavaScript), which is the recommended pattern for production AMQP workloads. Only one epoch consumer can own a given partition in a consumer group at a time. If you deploy more processor instances than partitions, the extra instances aren't assigned any partitions and sit idle until an existing owner releases one. If a new epoch consumer connects with a higher owner level, the service disconnects the current owner with a `ConsumerDisconnected` error, and the new consumer takes over.
- **Non-epoch consumers** — Up to 5 non-epoch receivers can read the same partition concurrently within a consumer group. Each receiver sees the same events (fan-out), so this mode doesn't increase processing throughput per partition. Connecting an epoch consumer to a partition disconnects all non-epoch consumers on that partition.
- **Kafka consumers** — Kafka consumers use the group coordination protocol (`group.id`) instead of AMQP epochs, but the partition-ownership model is equivalent: each partition is assigned to exactly one consumer member within a consumer group at a time. When a new member joins or an existing member leaves, the group rebalances and redistributes partition assignments. If there are more consumer members than partitions, the excess members receive no assignments and remain idle until a future rebalance frees up a partition. To reduce unnecessary rebalancing from transient disconnections, set a unique `group.instance.id` per consumer instance (static membership).

In practice, **the number of partitions equals the maximum number of parallel consumers per consumer group** regardless of whether you use AMQP epoch consumers or Kafka consumers. Factor this into your partition count when you plan for scale-out.

If your application has an affinity to a particular partition, increasing the number of partitions isn't beneficial. For more information, see [availability and consistency](event-hubs-availability-and-consistency.md).


### Mapping of events to partitions
You can use a partition key to map incoming event data into specific partitions for the purpose of data organization. The partition key is a sender-supplied value passed into an event hub. It's processed through a static hashing function, which creates the partition assignment. If you don't specify a partition key when publishing an event, a round-robin assignment is used.

The event publisher is only aware of its partition key, not the partition to which the events are published. This decoupling of key and partition insulates the sender from needing to know too much about the downstream processing. A per-device or user unique identity makes a good partition key, but other attributes such as geography can also be used to group related events into a single partition.

Specifying a partition key enables keeping related events together in the same partition and in the exact order in which they arrived. The partition key is some string that is derived from your application context and identifies the interrelationship of the events. A sequence of events identified by a partition key is a *stream*. A partition is a multiplexed log store for many such streams. 

> **Note:**
> While you can send events directly to partitions, we don't recommend it, especially when high availability is important to you. It downgrades the availability of an event hub to partition-level.
