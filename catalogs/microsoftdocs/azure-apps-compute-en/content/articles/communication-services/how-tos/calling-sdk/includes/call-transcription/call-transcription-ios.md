## Set up your system

Follow these steps to set up your system.

### Create the Xcode project

In Xcode, create a new iOS project and select the **Single View App** template. This article uses the [SwiftUI framework](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), so you should set **Language** to **Swift** and set **Interface** to **SwiftUI**.

You're not going to create tests in this article. Feel free to clear the **Include Tests** checkbox.

### Install the package and dependencies by using CocoaPods

1. Create a Podfile for your application, like this example:

    ```
    platform :ios, '13.0'
    use_frameworks!
    target 'AzureCommunicationCallingSample' do
        pod 'AzureCommunicationCalling', '~> 1.0.0'
    end
    ```

1. Run `pod install`.

1. Open `.xcworkspace` by using Xcode.

### Request access to the microphone

To access the device's microphone, you need to update your app's information property list by using `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`. Set the associated value to a string that's included in the dialog that the system uses to request access from the user.

Right-click the **Info.plist** entry of the project tree, and then select **Open As** > **Source Code**. Add the following lines in the top-level `<dict>` section, and then save the file.

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Need microphone access for VOIP calling.</string>
```

### Set up the app framework

Open your project's `ContentView.swift` file. Add an `import` declaration to the top of the file to import the `AzureCommunicationCalling` library. In addition, import `AVFoundation`. You need it for audio permission requests in the code.

```swift
import AzureCommunicationCalling
import AVFoundation
```

### Initialize CallAgent

To create a `CallAgent` instance from `CallClient`, you have to use a `callClient.createCallAgent` method that asynchronously returns a `CallAgent` object after it's initialized.

To create a call client, pass a `CommunicationTokenCredential` object:

```swift
import AzureCommunication

let tokenString = "token_string"
var userCredential: CommunicationTokenCredential?
do {
    let options = CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions(initialToken: token, refreshProactively: true, tokenRefresher: self.fetchTokenSync)
    userCredential = try CommunicationTokenCredential(withOptions: options)
} catch {
    updates("Couldn't created Credential object", false)
    initializationDispatchGroup!.leave()
    return
}

// tokenProvider needs to be implemented by Contoso, which fetches a new token
public func fetchTokenSync(then onCompletion: TokenRefreshOnCompletion) {
    let newToken = self.tokenProvider!.fetchNewToken()
    onCompletion(newToken, nil)
}
```

Pass the `CommunicationTokenCredential` object that you created to `CallClient`, and set the display name:

```swift
self.callClient = CallClient()
let callAgentOptions = CallAgentOptions()
options.displayName = " iOS Azure Communication Services User"

self.callClient!.createCallAgent(userCredential: userCredential!,
    options: callAgentOptions) { (callAgent, error) in
        if error == nil {
            print("Create agent succeeded")
            self.callAgent = callAgent
        } else {
            print("Create agent failed")
        }
})
```


> **Warning:**
> Up until version 1.1.0 and beta release version 1.1.0-beta.1 of the Azure Communication Services Calling iOS SDK has the `isTranscriptionActive` as part of the `Call` object and `didChangeTranscriptionState` is part of `CallDelegate` delegate. For new beta releases, those features are now as an extended feature of `Call` as described later in this article.

Call transcription is an extended feature of the core `Call` object. You first need to obtain the transcription feature object:

```swift
let callTranscriptionFeature = call.feature(Features.transcription)
```

Then, to check if the call is transcribed, inspect the `isTranscriptionActive` property of `callTranscriptionFeature`. It returns `Bool`.

```swift
let isTranscriptionActive = callTranscriptionFeature.isTranscriptionActive;
```

You can also subscribe to transcription changes by implementing `TranscriptionCallFeatureDelegate` delegate on your class with the event `didChangeTranscriptionState`:

```swift
callTranscriptionFeature.delegate = self

// didChangeTranscriptionState is a member of TranscriptionCallFeatureDelegate
public func transcriptionCallFeature(_ transcriptionCallFeature: TranscriptionCallFeature, didChangeTranscriptionState args: PropertyChangedEventArgs) {
    let isTranscriptionActive = callTranscriptionFeature.isTranscriptionActive
}
```
## Explicit Consent
> **Note:**
> This API is provided as a preview for developers and might change based on feedback that we receive. Don't use this API in a production environment. To use this API, use the beta release of the Azure Communication Services Calling iOS SDK.

When your Teams meeting or call is configured to require explicit consent for recording or transcription, you're required to gather explicit consent from your users to permit users to be transcribed or recorded. You can provide consent proactively when joining the meeting or reactively when the recording or transcription starts. Until explicit consent is given, participants' audio, video, and screen sharing is disabled during transcription.

You can check if the meeting transcription requires explicit consent by property `isTeamsConsentRequired`. If the value is set to `true`, then explicit consent is required for the `call`.

```swift
let isTranscriptionConsentRequired = callTranscriptionFeature.isTeamsConsentRequired;
```

If you already obtained the user's consent for transcription, you can call the `grantTeamsConsent()` method to indicate explicit consent to the service. This consent is valid for one `call` session only and users need to provide consent again if they rejoin the meeting.

```swift
callTranscriptionFeature.grantTeamsConsent();
```
Attempts to enable audio, video, or screen sharing fail when transcription is active, explicit consent is required but isn't yet given. You can recognize this situation by checking property `reason` of class `ParticipantCapabilities` for [capabilities](../../capabilities.md) `turnVideoOn`, `unmuteMic`, and `shareScreen`. You can find those [capabilities](../../capabilities.md) in the feature `call.feature(Features.Capabilities)`. Those [capabilities](../../capabilities.md) would return reason `ExplicitConsentRequired` as users need to provide explicit consent.
