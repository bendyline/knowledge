## Install the SDK

Use the `npm install` command to install the Azure Communication Services Common and Calling SDK for JavaScript:

```console
npm install @azure/communication-common --save
npm install @azure/communication-calling --save
```

## Initialize required objects

A `CallClient` instance is required for most call operations. When you create a new `CallClient` instance, you can configure it with custom options like a `Logger` instance.

With the `CallClient` instance, you can create a `CallAgent` instance by calling the `createCallAgent`. This method asynchronously returns a `CallAgent` instance object.

The `createCallAgent` method uses `CommunicationTokenCredential` as an argument. It accepts a [user access token](../../../../quickstarts/identity/access-tokens.md).

You can use the `getDeviceManager` method on the `CallClient` instance to access `deviceManager`.

```js
const { CallClient } = require('@azure/communication-calling');
const { AzureCommunicationTokenCredential} = require('@azure/communication-common');
const { AzureLogger, setLogLevel } = require("@azure/logger");

// Set the logger's log level
setLogLevel('verbose');

// Redirect log output to console, file, buffer, REST API, or whatever location you want
AzureLogger.log = (...args) => {
    console.log(...args); // Redirect log output to console
};

const userToken = '<USER_TOKEN>';
callClient = new CallClient(options);
const tokenCredential = new AzureCommunicationTokenCredential(userToken);
const callAgent = await callClient.createCallAgent(tokenCredential, {displayName: 'optional Azure Communication Services user name'});
const deviceManager = await callClient.getDeviceManager()
```

### Manage SDK connectivity to Microsoft infrastructure

The `Call Agent` instance helps you manage calls (to join or start calls). In order to work your calling SDK needs to connect to Microsoft infrastructure to get notifications of incoming calls and coordinate other call details. Your `Call Agent` has two possible states:

**Connected** - A `Call Agent` connectionStatue value of `Connected` means the client SDK is connected and capable of receiving notifications from Microsoft infrastructure.

**Disconnected** - A `Call Agent` connectionStatue value of `Disconnected` states there's an issue that is preventing the SDK it from properly connecting. `Call Agent` should be re-created.
- `invalidToken`: If a token is expired or is invalid `Call Agent` instance disconnects with this error.
- `connectionIssue`:  If there's an issue with the client connecting to Microsoft infrastructure, after many retries `Call Agent` exposes the `connectionIssue` error.

You can check if your local `Call Agent` is connected to Microsoft infrastructure by inspecting the current value of `connectionState` property. During an active call you can listen to the `connectionStateChanged` event to determine if `Call Agent` changes from **Connected** to **Disconnected** state.

```js
const connectionState = callAgentInstance.connectionState;
console.log(connectionState); // it may return either of 'Connected' | 'Disconnected'

const connectionStateCallback = (args) => {
    console.log(args); // it will return an object with oldState and newState, each of having a value of either of 'Connected' | 'Disconnected'
    // it will also return reason, either of 'invalidToken' | 'connectionIssue'
}
callAgentInstance.on('connectionStateChanged', connectionStateCallback);
```




> **Warning:**
> Due to changes in Microsoft Teams, JavaScript calling SDKs with versions 1.21 and lower stops Teams transcription and blocks Teams users to start transcription. If you would like to use Teams transcription in the calls and meetings, you need to upgrade your calling SDK to at least version 1.22.

## Call transcription 

`Transcription` is an extended feature of the class `Call`. You first need to obtain the transcription feature API object

```js
const callTranscriptionFeature = call.feature(Features.Transcription);
```

You can check state of the transcription in the property `isTranscriptionActive`. If value is set to `true`, then transcription is active.

```js
const isTranscriptionActive = callTranscriptionFeature.isTranscriptionActive;
```

You can subscribe to event that is triggered when state of transcription changes:

```js
const isTranscriptionActiveChangedHandler = () => {
  console.log(callTranscriptionFeature.isTranscriptionActive);
};
callTranscriptionFeature.on('isTranscriptionActiveChanged', isTranscriptionActiveChangedHandler);
```

You can unsubscribe from the event with the following code: 

```js
callTranscriptionFeature.off('isTranscriptionActiveChanged', isTranscriptionActiveChangedHandler);
```

## Explicit Consent
When your Teams meeting or call is configured to require explicit consent for recording or transcription, you're required to gather explicit consent from your users to permit users to be transcribed or recorded. You can provide consent proactively when joining the meeting or reactively when the recording or transcription starts. Until explicit consent is given, participants' audio, video, and screen sharing is disabled during transcription.

You can check if the meeting transcription requires explicit consent by property `isTeamsConsentRequired`. If the value is set to `true`, then explicit consent is required for the `call`.

```js
const isTranscriptionConsentRequired = callTranscriptionFeature.isTeamsConsentRequired;
```

If you already obtained the user's consent for transcription, you can call the `grantTeamsConsent()` method to indicate explicit consent to the service. This consent is valid for one `call` session only and users need to provide consent again if they rejoin the meeting.

```js
callTranscriptionFeature.grantTeamsConsent();
```
Attempts to enable audio, video, or screen sharing fail when transcription is active, explicit consent is required but isn't yet given. You can recognize this situation by checking property `reason` of class `ParticipantCapabilities` for [capabilities](../../capabilities.md) `turnVideoOn`, `unmuteMic`, and `shareScreen`. You can find those [capabilities](../../capabilities.md) in the feature `call.feature(Features.Capabilities)`. Those [capabilities](../../capabilities.md) would return reason `ExplicitConsentRequired` as users need to provide explicit consent.
