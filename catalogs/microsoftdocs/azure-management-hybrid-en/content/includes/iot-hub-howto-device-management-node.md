  *  Requires Node.js version 10.0.x or later

## Overview

This article describes how to use the [Azure IoT SDK for Node.js](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node) to create device and backend service application code for device direct methods.

## Create a device application

This section describes how to use device application code to create a direct method callback.

### Install SDK package

The [azure-iot-device](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iot-device) package contains objects that interface with IoT devices. Run this command to install the **azure-iot-device** device SDK on your development machine:

```cmd/sh
npm install azure-iot-device --save
```

### Connect a device to IoT Hub

A device app can authenticate with IoT Hub using the following methods:

* X.509 certificate
* Shared access key


>**Important:**
>This article includes steps to connect a device using a shared access signature, also called symmetric key authentication. This authentication method is convenient for testing and evaluation, but authenticating a device using X.509 certificates is a more secure approach. To learn more, see [Security best practices for IoT solutions > Connection security](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/iot/iot-overview-security.md#connection-security).


#### Authenticate using an X.509 certificate


The X.509 certificate is attached to the device-to-IoT Hub connection transport.

To configure a device-to-IoT Hub connection using an X.509 certificate:

1. Call [fromConnectionString](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iothub/client?#azure-iothub-client-fromconnectionstring) to add the device or identity module connection string, and transport type to the `Client` object. Add `x509=true` to the connection string to indicate that a certificate is added to `DeviceClientOptions`. For example:

   * A **device** connection string:
   
     `HostName=xxxxx.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=Device-1;SharedAccessKey=xxxxxxxxxxxxx;x509=true`
   * An **identity module** connection string:
   
     `HostName=xxxxx.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=Device-1;ModuleId=Module-1;SharedAccessKey=xxxxxxxxxxxxx;x509=true`

1. Configure a JSON variable with certificate details and pass it to [DeviceClientOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iot-device/deviceclientoptions).
1. Call [setOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iot-device/client?#azure-iot-device-client-setoptions-1) to add an X.509 certificate and key (and optionally, passphrase) to the client transport.
1. Call [open](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iothub/client?#azure-iothub-client-open) to open the connection from the device to IoT Hub.

This example shows certificate configuration information within a JSON variable. The certification configuration `clientOptions` are passed to `setOptions`, and the connection is opened using `open`.

```javascript
const Client = require('azure-iot-device').Client;
const Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-mqtt').Mqtt;
// Connection string illustrated for demonstration only. Never hard-code the connection string in production. Instead use an environmental variable or other secure storage.
const connectionString = `HostName=xxxxx.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=Device-1;SharedAccessKey=xxxxxxxxxxxxx;x509=true`
const client = Client.fromConnectionString(connectionString, Protocol);

var clientOptions = {
   cert: myX509Certificate,
   key: myX509Key,
   passphrase: passphrase,
   http: {
     receivePolicy: {
       interval: 10
     }
   }
 }

 client.setOptions(clientOptions);
 client.open(connectCallback);
```

For more information about certificate authentication, see:

* [Authenticate identities with X.509 certificates](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/authenticate-authorize-x509)
* [Create and upload certificates for testing](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/tutorial-x509-test-certs)

##### Code sample

For a working sample of device X.509 certificate authentication, see [Simple sample device X.509](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node/blob/main/device/samples/javascript/simple_sample_device_x509.js).


#### Authenticate using a shared access key

##### Choose a transport protocol

The `Client` object supports these protocols:

* `Amqp`
* `Http` - When using `Http`, the `Client` instance checks for messages from IoT Hub infrequently (a minimum of every 25 minutes).
* `Mqtt`
* `MqttWs`
* `AmqpWs`

Install needed transport protocols on your development machine.

For example, this command installs the `Amqp` protocol:

```cmd/sh
npm install azure-iot-device-amqp --save
```

For more information about the differences between MQTT, AMQP, and HTTPS support, see [Cloud-to-device communications guidance](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-c2d-guidance.md) and [Choose a communication protocol](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-protocols.md).

##### Create a client object

Create a `Client` object using the installed package.

For example:

```javascript
const Client = require('azure-iot-device').Client;
```

##### Create a protocol object

Create a `Protocol` object using an installed transport package.

This example assigns the AMQP protocol:

```javascript
const Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-amqp').Amqp;
```

##### Add the device connection string and transport protocol

Call [fromConnectionString](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iot-device/client?#azure-iot-device-client-fromconnectionstring) to supply device connection parameters:

* **connStr** - The device connection string.
* **transportCtor** - The transport protocol.

This example uses the `Amqp` transport protocol:

```javascript
const deviceConnectionString = "{IoT hub device connection string}"
const Protocol = require('azure-iot-device-mqtt').Amqp;
let client = Client.fromConnectionString(deviceConnectionString, Protocol);
```

##### Open the connection to IoT Hub

Use the [open](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iot-device/client?#azure-iot-device-client-open) method to open connection between an IoT device and IoT Hub.

For example:

```javascript
client.open(function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error('error connecting to hub: ' + err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
})
```

### Create a direct method callback

Call [onDeviceMethod](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iot-device/client?#azure-iot-device-client-ondevicemethod) to create a callback handler function or coroutine that is called when a direct method is received. The listener is associated with a method name keyword, such as "reboot". The method name can be used in an IoT Hub or backend application to trigger the callback method on the device.

The callback handler function should call `response.send` to send a response acknowledgment message to the calling application.

This example sets up a direct method handler named `onReboot` that is called when the "reboot" direct method name is used.

```javascript
client.onDeviceMethod('reboot', onReboot);
```

In this example, the `onReboot` callback method implements the direct method on the device. The code is executed when the "reboot" direct method is called from a service application. The function calls `response.send` to send a response acknowledgment message to the calling application.

```javascript
var onReboot = function(request, response) {

    // Respond the cloud app for the direct method
    response.send(200, 'Reboot started', function(err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('An error occurred when sending a method response:\n' + err.toString());
        } else {
            console.log('Response to method \'' + request.methodName + '\' sent successfully.');
        }
    });

    // Add your device's reboot API for physical restart.
    console.log('Rebooting!');
};
```

## Create a backend application

This section describes how to invoke a direct method on a device.

### Install service SDK package

Run this command to install **azure-iothub** on your development machine:

```cmd/sh
npm install azure-iothub --save
```

### Connect to IoT hub

You can connect a backend service to IoT Hub using the following methods:

* Shared access policy
* Microsoft Entra


>**Important:**
>This article includes steps to connect to a service using a shared access signature. This authentication method is convenient for testing and evaluation, but authenticating to a service with Microsoft Entra ID or managed identities is a more secure approach. To learn more, see [Security best practices for IoT solutions > Cloud security](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/iot/iot-overview-security.md#cloud-security).


#### Connect using a shared access policy

Use [fromConnectionString](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iothub/client?#azure-iothub-client-fromconnectionstring) to connect to IoT hub.

To invoke a direct method on a device through IoT Hub, your service needs the **service connect** permission. By default, every IoT Hub is created with a shared access policy named **service** that grants this permission.

As a parameter to `CreateFromConnectionString`, supply the **service** shared access policy connection string. For more information about shared access policies, see [Control access to IoT Hub with shared access signatures](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/authenticate-authorize-sas).

```javascript
var Client = require('azure-iothub').Client;
var connectionString = '{IoT hub shared access policy connection string}';
var client = Client.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
```

#### Connect using Microsoft Entra


A backend app that uses Microsoft Entra must successfully authenticate and obtain a security token credential before connecting to IoT Hub. This token is passed to a IoT Hub connection method. For general information about setting up and using Microsoft Entra for IoT Hub, see [Control access to IoT Hub by using Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/authenticate-authorize-azure-ad).

For an overview of Node.js SDK authentication, see:

* [Getting started with user authentication on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/how-to/with-authentication/getting-started)
* [Azure Identity client library for JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/azure/identity-readme)

##### Configure Microsoft Entra app

You must set up a Microsoft Entra app that is configured for your preferred authentication credential. The app contains parameters such as client secret that are used by the backend application to authenticate. The available app authentication configurations are:

* Client secret
* Certificate
* Federated identity credential

Microsoft Entra apps may require specific role permissions depending on operations being performed. For example, [IoT Hub Twin Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/internet-of-things#iot-hub-twin-contributor) is required to enable read and write access to a IoT Hub device and module twins. For more information, see [Manage access to IoT Hub by using Azure RBAC role assignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/authenticate-authorize-azure-ad?#manage-access-to-iot-hub-by-using-azure-rbac-role-assignment).

For more information about setting up a Microsoft Entra app, see [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app).

##### Authenticate using DefaultAzureCredential

The easiest way to use Microsoft Entra to authenticate a backend application is to use [DefaultAzureCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/identity/defaultazurecredential), but it's recommended to use a different method in a production environment including a specific `TokenCredential` or pared-down `ChainedTokenCredential`. For simplicity, this section describes authentication using `DefaultAzureCredential` and Client secret.
For more information about the pros and cons of using `DefaultAzureCredential`, see
[Credential chains in the Azure Identity client library for JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/sdk/credential-chains#use-defaultazurecredential-for-flexibility)

[DefaultAzureCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/identity/defaultazurecredential) supports different authentication mechanisms and determines the appropriate credential type based on the environment it's executing in. It attempts to use multiple credential types in an order until it finds a working credential.

Microsoft Entra requires this package:

```shell
npm install --save @azure/identity
```

In this example, Microsoft Entra app registration client secret, client ID, and tenant ID have been added to environment variables. These environment variables are used by `DefaultAzureCredential` to authenticate the application. The result of a successful Microsoft Entra authentication is a security token credential that is passed to an IoT Hub connection method.

```javascript
import { DefaultAzureCredential } from "@azure/identity";

// Azure SDK clients accept the credential as a parameter
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
```

The resulting credential token can then be passed to [fromTokenCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iothub/registry?#azure-iothub-registry-fromtokencredential) to connect to IoT Hub for any SDK client that accepts Microsoft Entra credentials:

* [Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iothub/registry?#azure-iothub-registry-fromtokencredential)
* [Client](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iothub/client?#azure-iothub-client-fromtokencredential)
* [JobClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iothub/jobclient?#azure-iothub-jobclient-fromtokencredential)

`fromTokenCredential` requires two parameters:

* The Azure service URL - The Azure service URL should be in the format `{Your Entra domain URL}.azure-devices.net` without a `https://` prefix. For example, `MyAzureDomain.azure-devices.net`.
* The Azure credential token

In this example, the Azure credential is obtained using `DefaultAzureCredential`. The Azure domain URL and credential are then supplied to `Registry.fromTokenCredential` to create the connection to IoT Hub.

```javascript
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");

let Registry = require('azure-iothub').Registry;

// Define the client secret values
clientSecretValue = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
clientID = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
tenantID = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxx'

// Set environment variables
process.env['AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET'] = clientSecretValue;
process.env['AZURE_CLIENT_ID'] = clientID;
process.env['AZURE_TENANT_ID'] = tenantID;

// Acquire a credential object
const credential = new DefaultAzureCredential()

// Create an instance of the IoTHub registry
hostName = 'MyAzureDomain.azure-devices.net';
let registry = Registry.fromTokenCredential(hostName,credential);
```

##### Code samples

For working samples of Microsoft Entra service authentication, see [Azure identity examples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/@azure/identity_4.5.0/sdk/identity/identity/samples/AzureIdentityExamples.md).


### Invoke a method on a device

Use [invokeDeviceMethod](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/azure-iothub/client?#azure-iothub-client-invokedevicemethod) to invoke a direct method by name on a device. The method name parameter identifies the direct method.

This example calls the "reboot" method to initiate a reboot on the device. The "reboot" method is mapped to a callback handler function on the device as described in the **Create a direct method callback** section of this article.

```javascript
var startRebootDevice = function(deviceToReboot) {

    var methodName = "reboot";

    var methodParams = {
        methodName: methodName,
        payload: null,
        timeoutInSeconds: 30
    };

    client.invokeDeviceMethod(deviceToReboot, methodParams, function(err, result) {
        if (err) {
            console.error("Direct method error: "+err.message);
        } else {
            console.log("Successfully invoked the device to reboot.");  
        }
    });
};
```
