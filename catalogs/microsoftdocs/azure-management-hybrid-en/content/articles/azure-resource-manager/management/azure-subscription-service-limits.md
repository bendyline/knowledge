# Azure subscription and service limits, quotas, and constraints

This document lists some of the most common Microsoft Azure limits, which are also sometimes called quotas.

- To learn more about Azure pricing, see the [Azure pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) overview and details page.
- The Azure pricing page provides details for specific services; for example, [Windows Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/Windows/).
- You can also use the Azure [pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) to estimate your costs.
- See [What is Microsoft Billing?](../../cost-management-billing/cost-management-billing-overview.md) for tips to help manage your costs.

## How to manage limits

> **Note:**
> Some services have adjustable limits.
>
> When the limit can be adjusted, the tables include **Default limit** and **Maximum limit** headers. The limit can be raised above the default limit but not above the maximum limit. Some services with adjustable limits use different headers with information about adjusting the limit.
>
> When a service doesn't have adjustable limits, the following tables use the header **Limit** without any additional information about adjusting the limit. In those cases, the default and the maximum limits are the same.
>
> If you want to raise the limit or quota above the default limit, [open an online customer support request at no charge](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-resource-quota.md#solution).
>
> The terms *soft limit* and *hard limit* are often used informally to describe the current, adjustable limit (soft limit) and the maximum limit (hard limit). If a limit isn't adjustable, there won't be a soft limit but only a hard limit.
>

[Free Azure trial subscriptions](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0044p?cid=msft_learn) aren't eligible for limit or quota increases. If you have this type of subscription, you can upgrade to a [Pay-as-you-go](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0003p?cid=msft_learn) one. For more information, see [Upgrade your Azure account](../../cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription.md) and the overviews for [Try Azure for free or pay as you go](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).

Some limits are managed at a regional level. You decide what your quotas must be for your workload in any one region, and then request that amount for each region into which you want to deploy.

For example, with virtual central processing unit (vCPU) quotas:

- To request a quota increase with support for vCPUs, you decide how many vCPUs to use in which regions.
- You then request an increase in vCPU quotas for the amounts and regions that you want.
- If you need to use 30 vCPUs in West Europe to run your application there, you specifically request 30 vCPUs in West Europe.
- Your vCPU quota doesn't increase in any other region; only West Europe has the 30-vCPU quota.

See [Resolve errors for resource quotas](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-resource-quota.md) for more information about how to determine quotas for specific regions.

## General limits

- See [Naming rules and restrictions for Azure resources](resource-name-rules.md) for limits on resource names.
- See [Understand how Azure Resource Manager throttles requests](request-limits-and-throttling.md) to learn about Resource Manager API read and write limits.

### Azure management group limits

The following limits apply to [Azure management groups](../../governance/management-groups/overview.md).


| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Management groups per Microsoft Entra tenant | 10,000 |
| Subscriptions per management group | Unlimited |
| Levels of management group hierarchy | Root level plus 6 levels<sup>1</sup> |
| Direct parent management group per management group | One |
| [Management group level deployments](../templates/deploy-to-management-group.md) | 800<sup>2</sup> |
| Locations of [Management group level deployments](../templates/deploy-to-management-group.md) | 10 |

<sup>1</sup>The 6 levels don't include the subscription level.

<sup>2</sup>If you reach the limit of 800 deployments, delete deployments from the history that are no longer needed. To delete management group level deployments, use [Remove-AzManagementGroupDeployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.resources/Remove-AzManagementGroupDeployment) or [az deployment mg delete](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/deployment/mg#az-deployment-mg-delete). Deployments are automatically deleted from the history as you near the limit. Deleting an entry from the deployment history doesn't affect the deployed resources. For more information, see [Automatic deletions from deployment history](../templates/deployment-history-deletions.md).


### Azure subscription limits

The following limits apply when you use Azure Resource Manager and Azure resource groups.

| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Azure subscriptions [associated with a Microsoft Entra tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory) | Unlimited |
| [Coadministrators](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/add-change-subscription-administrator) per subscription | Unlimited |
| [Resource groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview) per subscription | 980 |
| Azure Resource Manager API request size | 4,194,304 bytes |
| Tags per subscription<sup>1</sup> | 50 |
| Unique tag calculations per subscription<sup>2</sup> | 80,000 |
| [Subscription-level deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-subscription) | 800<sup>3</sup> |
| Locations of [Subscription-level deployments](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-to-subscription) | 10 |

<sup>1</sup>You can apply up to 50 tags directly to a subscription. Within the subscription, each resource or resource group is also limited to 50 tags. However, the subscription can contain an unlimited number of tags that are dispersed across resources and resource groups.

<sup>2</sup>Resource Manager returns a list of tag name and values in the subscription only when the number of unique tags is 80,000 or less. A unique tag is defined by the combination of resource ID, tag name, and tag value. For example, two resources with the same tag name and value would be calculated as two unique tags. You still can find a resource by tag when the number exceeds 80,000.

<sup>3</sup>Deployments are automatically deleted from the history as you near the limit. For more information, see Automatic deletions from deployment history.

Note that subscription IDs must be non-empty GUIDs.

### Azure resource group limits


| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Resources per [resource group](overview.md#resource-groups) | Resources aren't limited by resource group. Instead, they're limited by resource type in a resource group. See next row. |
| Resources per resource group, per resource type | 800 - Some resource types can exceed the 800 limit. See [Resources not limited to 800 instances per resource group](resources-without-resource-group-limit.md). |
| Deployments per resource group in the deployment history | 800<sup>1</sup> |
| Resources per deployment | 800 |
| Management locks per unique [scope](overview.md#understand-scope) | 20 |
| Number of tags per resource or resource group | 50 |
| Tag key length | 512 |
| Tag value length | 256 |

<sup>1</sup>Deployments are automatically deleted from the history as you near the limit. Deleting an entry from the deployment history doesn't affect the deployed resources. For more information, see [Automatic deletions from deployment history](../templates/deployment-history-deletions.md).

#### Template limits

| Value | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Parameters | 256 |
| Variables | 256 |
| Resources (including copy count) | 800 |
| Outputs | 64 |
| Template expression | 24,576 chars |
| Resources in exported templates | 200 |
| Template size | 4 MB |
| Resource definition size | 1 MB |
| Parameter file size | 4 MB |

You can exceed some template limits by using a nested template. For more information, see [Use linked templates when you deploy Azure resources](../templates/linked-templates.md). To reduce the number of parameters, variables, or outputs, you can combine several values into an object. For more information, see [Objects as parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/guide/azure-resource-manager/advanced-templates/objects-as-parameters).

You may get an error with a template or parameter file of less than 4 MB, if the total size of the request is too large. For more information about how to simplify your template to avoid a large request, see [Resolve errors for job size exceeded](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/azure-resource-manager/templates/error-job-size-exceeded.md).

<sup>1</sup> Apps and storage quotas are per App Service plan unless noted otherwise.

<sup>2</sup> The actual number of apps that you can host on these machines depends on the activity of the apps, the size of the machine instances, and the corresponding resource utilization.

<sup>3</sup> Dedicated instances can be of different sizes. For more information, see [App Service pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/).

<sup>4</sup> More are allowed upon request.

<sup>5</sup> The storage limit is the total content size across all apps in the same App service plan. The total content size of all apps across all App service plans in a single resource group and region cannot exceed 500 GB. The file system quota for App Service hosted apps is determined by the aggregate of App Service plans created in a region and resource group.

<sup>6</sup> These resources are constrained by physical resources on the dedicated instances (the instance size and the number of instances).

<sup>7</sup>If you scale a Windows app in the Basic tier to two instances, you have 350 concurrent connections for each of the two instances. For Windows apps on Standard tier and above, there are no theoretical limits to WebSockets, but other factors can limit the number of WebSockets. For example, maximum concurrent requests allowed (defined by `maxConcurrentRequestsPerCpu`) are: 7,500 per small VM, 15,000 per medium VM (7,500 x 2 cores), and 75,000 per large VM (18,750 x 4 cores). Linux apps are limited 5 concurrent WebSocket connections on Free SKU and ~50k concurrent WebSocket connections per instance on all other SKUs.

<sup>8</sup> The maximum IP connections are per instance and depend on the instance size: 1,920 per B1/S1/P0V3/P1V3/P0V4/P1V4 instance, 3,968 per B2/S2/P2V3/P2V4 instance, 8,064 per B3/S3/P3V3/P4V4 instance.

<sup>9</sup> App Service Isolated SKUs can be internally load balanced (ILB) with Azure Load Balancer, so there's no public connectivity from the internet. As a result, some features of an ILB Isolated App Service must be used from machines that have direct access to the ILB network endpoint.

<sup>10</sup> Run custom executables and/or scripts on demand, on a schedule, or continuously as a background task within your App Service instance. Always On is required for continuous WebJobs execution. There's no predefined limit on the number of WebJobs that can run in an App Service instance. There are practical limits that depend on what the application code is trying to do.

<sup>11</sup> Only issuing standard certificates (wildcard certificates aren't available). Limited to only one free certificate per custom domain.

<sup>12</sup> Total storage usage across all apps deployed in a single App Service environment (regardless of how they're allocated across different resource groups).

Notes on service limits:

1. On Container Apps, you can set the [maximum number of replicas](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/scale-app#scale-definition), which the platform honors as long as there's enough cores quota available.
2. Requires the App Service plan be set to [Always On](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan#always-on). Pay at standard [rates](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/). A grace period of 10 minutes is given for HTTP triggered functions during platform updates but not for other triggers.
3. These limits are [set in the host](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/blob/dev/src/WebJobs.Script.WebHost/web.config).  
4. The actual number of function apps that you can host depends on the activity of the apps, the size of the machine instances, and the corresponding resource utilization.  
5. The storage limit is the total content size in temporary storage across all apps in the same App Service plan. For Consumption plans on Linux, the storage is currently 1.5 GB.
6. Consumption plan uses an Azure Files share for persisted storage. When you provide your own Azure Files share, the specific share size limits depend on the storage account you set for [WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings#website_contentazurefileconnectionstring). 
7. On Linux, you must [explicitly mount your own Azure Files share](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/storage-considerations#mount-file-shares).
8. When your function app is hosted in a [Consumption plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/consumption-plan), only the CNAME option is supported. For function apps in a [Premium plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-premium-plan) or an [App Service plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/dedicated-plan), you can map a custom domain using either a CNAME or an A record.  
9. There's no maximum execution timeout duration enforced. However, the grace period given to a function execution is 60 minutes [during scale in](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/azure-functions/event-driven-scaling.md#scale-in-behaviors) and 10 minutes during platform updates.
10. Workers are roles that host customer apps. Workers are available in three fixed sizes: One vCPU/3.5 GB RAM; Two vCPU/7 GB RAM; Four vCPU/14 GB RAM.   
11. See [App Service limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#app-service-limits) for details.  
12. Including the production slot.  
13. There's currently a limit of 5,000 function apps in a given subscription. 
14. Flex Consumption plan instance sizes are currently defined as 512 MB, 2,048 MB, or 4,096 MB. For more information, see [Instance memory](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/flex-consumption-plan#instance-sizes).  
15. For details, see [Scale](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/azure-functions/functions-scale.md#scale) in the Hosting comparison article.
16. When the [minimum number of replicas](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/scale-app#scale-definition) is set to zero, the default timeout depends on the specific triggers used in the app.
17. When the [minimum number of replicas](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/container-apps/scale-app.md#scale-definition) is set to one or more.



See [Azure Functions hosting options](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/azure-functions/functions-scale.md) for more information.

Health Data Services is a set of managed API services based on open standards and frameworks. Health Data Services enables workflows to improve healthcare and offers scalable and secure healthcare solutions. Health Data Services includes Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) service, the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) service, and MedTech service.

FHIR service is an implementation of the FHIR specification within Health Data Services. It enables you to combine in a single workspace one or more FHIR service instances with optional DICOM and MedTech service instances. Azure API for FHIR is generally available as a stand-alone service offering.

Each FHIR service instance in Azure Health Data Services has a storage limit of 4 TB by default. If you have more data, you can ask Microsoft to increase storage up to 100 TB for your FHIR service. To request storage greater than 4 TB, [create a support request](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview) on the Azure portal and use the issue type Service and Subscription limit (quotas).

| **Quota Name** | **Default Limit** | **Maximum Limit** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace | 10 | [Contact support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) | Limit per subscription |
| FHIR service | 10 | [Contact support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) | Limit per workspace |
| DICOM service | 10 | [Contact support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) | Limit per workspace |
| The per-subscription and per-workspace limits are enforced independently. To deploy more than 10 FHIR services in a subscription, distribute them across multiple workspaces. |

See [Quotas and service plans for Azure Spring Apps](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/spring-apps/basic-standard/quotas.md) to learn more about the limits for Azure Spring Apps.

## Azure Storage limits

This section lists the following limits for Azure Storage:

- [Standard storage account limits](#standard-storage-account-limits)
- [Azure Storage resource provider limits](#azure-storage-resource-provider-limits)
- [Azure Blob Storage limits](#azure-blob-storage-limits)
- [Azure Queue storage limits](#azure-queue-storage-limits)
- [Azure Table storage limits](#azure-table-storage-limits)

### Standard storage account limits

<!--like # storage accts -->

The following table describes default limits for Azure general-purpose v2 (GPv2), general-purpose v1 (GPv1), and Blob Storage accounts.

A few entries in the table also apply to disk access and are explicitly labeled. Disk access is a resource that is exclusively used for importing or exporting managed disks through [private links](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disks-restrict-import-export-overview#private-links).

Customers should use a GPv2 storage account, because [GPv1 is being retired](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/general-purpose-version-1-account-migration-overview). You can easily upgrade a GPv1 or Blob Storage account to a GPv2 account with no downtime and no need to copy data. For more information, see [Upgrade to a GPv2 storage account](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-upgrade).

The *ingress* limit refers to all data sent to a storage account or disk access. The *egress* limit refers to all data received from a storage account or disk access.

> **Note:**
> You can request higher capacity and ingress limits. To request an increase, contact [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/).

<sup>1</sup> For capacity management purposes, the default quotas for new Batch accounts in some regions and for some subscription
types have been reduced from the above range of values. In some cases, these limits have been reduced to zero. When you create a
new Batch account, [check your quotas](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-quota-limit#view-batch-quotas) and
[request an appropriate core or service quota increase](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-quota-limit#increase-a-quota), if necessary.
Alternatively, consider reusing Batch accounts that already have sufficient quota or user subscription pool allocation
Batch accounts to maintain core and VM family quota across all Batch accounts on the subscription. Service quotas like
active jobs or pools apply to each distinct Batch account even for user subscription pool allocation Batch accounts.

<sup>2</sup> To request an increase beyond this limit, contact Azure Support.


> **Note:**
> Default limits vary depending on the type of subscription you use to create a Batch account. Cores quotas shown are for Batch

## Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service limits


Some areas of this service have adjustable limits. The tables below include an *Adjustable?* column. If the limit is adjustable, the *Adjustable?* value is *Yes*.

The actual value that you can adjust a limit to might vary based on your deployment. Very large deployments might require multiple instances of DPS.

If your business requires a higher adjustable limit or quota, [open a support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest) to request additional resources. An increase request isn't guaranteed because each case requires individual review. Contact Microsoft support as early as possible during your implementation so the team can determine whether to approve your request and help you plan accordingly.

The following table lists the limits that apply to Azure IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service resources.

| Resource | Limit | Adjustable? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum device provisioning services per Azure subscription | 10 | Yes |

## Azure Managed Identity limits


- Each managed identity counts towards the object quota limit in a Microsoft Entra tenant as described in [Microsoft Entra service limits and restrictions](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/active-directory/enterprise-users/directory-service-limits-restrictions.md).
-	The rate at which managed identities can be created have the following limits:

    1. Per Microsoft Entra tenant per Azure region: 400 create operations per 20 seconds.
    2. Per Azure Subscription per Azure region : 80 create operations per 20 seconds.

-	The rate at which a user-assigned managed identity can be assigned with an Azure resource :

    1. Per Microsoft Entra tenant per Azure region: 400 assignment operations per 20 seconds.
    2. Per Azure Subscription per Azure region : 300 assignment operations per 20 seconds.


## Azure Media Services limits


> **Note:**
> For resources that aren't fixed, open a support ticket to ask for an increase in the quotas. Don't create additional Azure Media Services accounts in an attempt to obtain higher limits.

### Account limits

| Resource | Default Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Media Services accounts in a single subscription | 100 (fixed) |

### Asset limits

| Resource | Default Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Assets per Media Services account | 1,000,000 |

### Storage (media) limits

| Resource | Default Limit |
| --- | --- |
| File size | In some scenarios, there is a limit on the maximum file size supported for processing in Media Services. <sup>(1)</sup> |
| Storage accounts | 100<sup>(2)</sup> (fixed) |

<sup>1</sup> The maximum size supported for a single blob is currently up to 5 TB in Azure Blob Storage. Additional limits apply in Media Services based on the VM sizes that are used by the service. The size limit applies to the files that you upload and also the files that get generated as a result of Media Services processing (encoding or analyzing). If your source file is larger than 260-GB, your Job will likely fail.

<sup>2</sup> The storage accounts must be from the same Azure subscription.

### Jobs (encoding & analyzing) limits

| Resource | Default Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Jobs per Media Services account | 500,000 <sup>(3)</sup> (fixed) |
| Job inputs per Job | 50  (fixed) |
| Job outputs per Job | 20 (fixed) |
| Transforms per Media Services account | 100  (fixed) |
| Transform outputs in a Transform | 20 (fixed) |
| Files per job input | 10 (fixed) |

<sup>3</sup> This number includes queued, finished, active, and canceled Jobs. It does not include deleted Jobs.

Any Job record in your account older than 90 days will be automatically deleted, even if the total number of records is below the maximum quota.

### Live streaming limits

| Resource | Default Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Live Events <sup>(4)</sup> per Media Services account | 5 |
| Live Outputs per Live Event | 3 <sup>(5)</sup> |
| Max Live Output duration | [Size of the DVR window](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/live-event-cloud-dvr-time-how-to) |

<sup>4</sup> For detailed information about Live Event limitations, see [Live Event types comparison and limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/media-services/latest/live-event-types-comparison-reference).

<sup>5</sup> Live Outputs start on creation and stop when deleted.

### Packaging & delivery limits

| Resource | Default Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Streaming Endpoints (stopped or running) per Media Services account | 2 |
| Dynamic Manifest Filters | 100 |
| Streaming Policies | 100 <sup>(6)</sup> |
| Unique Streaming Locators associated with an Asset at one time | 100<sup>(7)</sup> (fixed) |

<sup>6</sup> When using a custom [Streaming Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ams/streaming-policy), you should design a limited set of such policies for your Media Service account, and re-use them for your StreamingLocators whenever the same encryption options and protocols are needed. You should not be creating a new Streaming Policy for each Streaming Locator.

<sup>7</sup> Streaming Locators are not designed for managing per-user access control. To give different access rights to individual users, use Digital Rights Management (DRM) solutions.

### Protection limits

| Resource | Default Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Options per Content Key Policy | 30 |
| Licenses per month for each of the DRM types on Media Services key delivery service per account | 1,000,000 |

### Support ticket

For resources that are not fixed, you may ask for the quotas to be raised, by opening a [support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest). Include detailed information in the request on the desired quota changes, use-case scenarios, and regions required. <br/>Do **not** create additional Azure Media Services accounts in an attempt to obtain higher limits.

<sup>4</sup> Currently, **JavaScript** is the only supported language.

#### Timeout values

##### From client to Front Door

- Header timeout - After establishing TCP/TLS connection, Front Door has a 5-second timeout for receiving all headers from the client. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send headers within 5 seconds. You can't configure this timeout value.
- HTTP keep-alive timeout - Front Door has a 90-second HTTP keep-alive timeout. The connection is terminated if the client doesn't send data for 90 seconds. You can't configure this timeout value.

##### Front Door to application back-end

- After the HTTP request gets forwarded to the back end, Azure Front Door waits for 60 seconds (Standard and Premium) or 30 seconds (classic) for the first packet from the back end. Then it returns a 503 error to the client, or 504 for a cached request. You can configure this value using the *originResponseTimeoutSeconds* field in Azure Front Door Standard and Premium API, or the sendRecvTimeoutSeconds field in the Azure Front Door (classic) API.

- After the back end receives the first packet, if the origin pauses for any reason in the middle of the response body beyond the originResponseTimeoutSeconds or sendRecvTimeoutSeconds, the response is canceled.

- Front Door uses HTTP keep-alive to keep connections open for reuse from previous requests. These connections have an idle timeout of 90 seconds. Azure Front Door disconnects idle connections after reaching the 90-second idle timeout. You can't configure this timeout value.

#### Upload and download data limit

|  | With chunked transfer encoding (CTE) | Without HTTP chunking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Download** | There's no limit on the download size. | There's no limit on the download size. |
| **Upload** | There's no limit as long as each CTE upload is less than 2 GB. | The size can't be larger than 2 GB. |

#### Other limits
- Maximum URL size - 8,192 bytes - Specifies maximum length of the raw URL (scheme + hostname + port + path + query string of the URL)
- Maximum Query String size - 4,096 bytes - Specifies the maximum length of the query string, in bytes.
- Maximum HTTP response header size from health probe URL - 4,096 bytes - Specifies the maximum length of all the response headers of health probes.

<sup>1</sup> "Supported number of VMs in the virtual network" refers to the count of resources that communicate through the gateway. This includes:

- Virtual Machines in the hub virtual network
- Virtual Machines in peered spoke virtual networks (Hub-Spoke topology)
- Private Endpoints
- Network Virtual Appliances (such as Application Gateway, Azure Firewall)
- Backend instances of PaaS services deployed in virtual networks (such as SQL Managed Instance, App Service Environment, Azure API Management in VNet mode)

The values in the table are estimates and vary depending on the CPU utilization of the gateway. If the CPU utilization is high and the number of supported VMs is exceeded, the gateway will start to drop packets.
> **Note:**
> ExpressRoute can facilitate up to 11,000 routes that span virtual network address spaces, on-premises networks, and any relevant virtual network peering connections. To ensure stability of your ExpressRoute connection, refrain from advertising more than 11,000 routes to ExpressRoute. The maximum number of routes advertised by gateway is 1,000 routes.

> **Important:**
> * Application performance depends on multiple factors, such as end-to-end latency and the number of traffic flows that the application opens. The numbers in the table represent the upper limit that the application can theoretically achieve in an ideal environment. Additionally, we perform routine host and OS maintenance on the ExpressRoute virtual network gateway, to maintain reliability of the service. During a maintenance period, the control plane and data path capacity of the gateway is reduced.
> * During a maintenance period, you might experience intermittent connectivity problems to private endpoint resources.
> * ExpressRoute supports a maximum TCP and UDP packet size of 1,400 bytes. Fragmented packets are not supported by ExpressRoute Gateways. Please adjust your application to prevent IP fragmentation. If IP fragmentation support is required, enable the [ExpressRoute FastPath](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/about-fastpath) feature to bypass the ExpressRoute gateway.
> * Azure Route Server can support up to 4,000 VMs. This limit includes VMs in virtual networks that are peered. For more information, see [Azure Route Server limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/route-server/overview#route-server-limits).
> * The values in the table above represent the limits at each Gateway SKU.

#### Gateway performance limits

The table in this section lists the results of performance tests for VpnGw SKUs. A VPN tunnel connects to a VPN gateway instance. Each instance throughput is mentioned in the throughput table in the previous section and is available aggregated across all tunnels connecting to that instance. The table shows the observed bandwidth and packets per second throughput per tunnel for the different gateway SKUs. All testing was performed between gateways (endpoints) within Azure across different regions with 100 connections and under standard load conditions. We used publicly available iPerf and CTSTraffic tools to measure performances for site-to-site connections

* The best performance was obtained when we used the GCMAES256 algorithm for both IPsec Encryption and Integrity.
* Average performance was obtained when using AES256 for IPsec Encryption and SHA256 for Integrity.
* The lowest performance was obtained when we used DES3 for IPsec Encryption and SHA256 for Integrity.

See [sizes for virtual machines in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/sizes?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json) for more information.

**For VM Applications**

When working with VM applications in Azure, you may encounter an error message that says "Operation could not be completed as it results in exceeding approved UnmanagedStorageAccountCount quota." This error occurs when you have reached the limit for the number of unmanaged storage accounts that you can use.

When you publish a VM application, Azure needs to replicate it across multiple regions. To do this, Azure creates an unmanaged storage account for each region. The number of unmanaged storage accounts that an application uses is determined by the number of replicas across all applications.

As a general rule, each storage account can accommodate up to 200 simultaneous connections. Below are options for resolving the "UnmanagedStorageAccountCount" error:

- Use page blobs for your source application blobs. Unmanaged accounts are only used for block blob replication. Page blobs have no such limits.
- Reduce the number of replicas for your VM Application versions or delete applications you no longer need.
- File a support request to obtain a quota increase.





See [VM Applications overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/vm-applications) for more information.

#### Azure disk encryption sets

Each region and subscription supports up to 5,000 disk encryption sets. [Contact Azure support](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/4260367da6fe93d74e80662f882dd4e9f52b8924/articles/communications-gateway/request-changes.md) to increase the quota.

## Azure Virtual Machines limits

### Azure Virtual Machines limits

| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Virtual machines per cloud service <sup>1</sup> | 50 |
| Input endpoints per cloud service <sup>2</sup> | 150 |

<sup>1</sup> Virtual machines created by using the classic deployment model instead of Azure Resource Manager are automatically stored in a cloud service. You can add more virtual machines to that cloud service for load balancing and availability. 

<sup>2</sup> Input endpoints allow communications to a virtual machine from outside the virtual machine's cloud service. Virtual machines in the same cloud service or virtual network can automatically communicate with each other.  


### Azure Virtual Machines limits - Azure Resource Manager

The following limits apply when you use Azure Resource Manager and Azure resource groups.


| Resource | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| VMs per [subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) | 25,000<sup>1</sup> per region. |
| VM total cores per [subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) | 20<sup>1</sup> per region. Contact support to increase limit. |
| Azure Spot VM total cores per [subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) | 20<sup>1</sup> per region. Contact support to increase limit. |
| VM per series, such as Dv2 and F, cores per [subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/) | 20<sup>1</sup> per region. Contact support to increase limit. |
| [Availability sets](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview) per subscription | 2,500 per region. |
| Virtual machines per availability set | 200 |
| [Proximity placement groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/proximity-placement-groups-portal) per [resource group](overview.md#resource-groups) | 800 |
| Certificates per availability set | 199<sup>2</sup> |
| Certificates per subscription | Unlimited<sup>3</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> Default limits vary by offer category type, such as Free Trial and Pay-As-You-Go, and by series, such as Dv2, F, and G. For example, the default for Enterprise Agreement subscriptions is 350. For security, subscriptions default to 20 cores to prevent large core deployments. If you need more cores, submit a support ticket.

<sup>2</sup> Properties such as SSH public keys are also pushed as certificates and count towards this limit. To bypass this limit, use the [Azure Key Vault extension for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/key-vault-windows) or the [Azure Key Vault extension for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/extensions/key-vault-linux) to install certificates.

<sup>3</sup> With Azure Resource Manager, certificates are stored in the Azure Key Vault. The number of certificates is unlimited for a subscription. There's a 1-MB limit of certificates per deployment, which consists of either a single VM or an availability set.

> **Note:**
> Virtual machine cores have a regional total limit. They also have a limit for regional per-size series, such as Dv2 and F. These limits are separately enforced. For example, consider a subscription with a US East total VM core limit of 30, an A series core limit of 30, and a D series core limit of 30. This subscription can deploy 30 A1 VMs, or 30 D1 VMs, or a combination of the two not to exceed a total of 30 cores. An example of a combination is 10 A1 VMs and 20 D1 VMs.

| **Number of PaaS resources across subscriptions associated with the same network security perimeter** | Supported up to 1000 as recommended limit. |

### Other limitations

Network security perimeter has other limitations as follows:

| **Limitation/Issue** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Missing field in network security perimeter access logs** | Network security perimeter access logs can be aggregated. If the fields 'count' and 'timeGeneratedEndTime' are missing, consider the aggregation count as 1. |
| **Association creations through SDK fails with permission issue** | 'Status: 403 (Forbidden); ErrorCode: AuthorizationFailed' might be received while performing action 'Microsoft.Network/locations/networkSecurityPerimeterOperationStatuses/read' over scope '/subscriptions/xyz/providers/Microsoft.Network/locations/xyz/networkSecurityPerimeterOperationStatuses/xyz'.  <br> <br> Until the fix, use permission 'Microsoft.Network/locations/*/read' or use WaitUntil.Started in CreateOrUpdateAsync SDK API for association creations. |
| **Resource names cannot be longer than 44 characters to support network security perimeter** | The network security perimeter resource association created from the Azure portal has the format `{resourceName}-{perimeter-guid}`. To align with the requirement name field can't have more than 80 characters, resources names would have to be limited to 44 characters. |
| **Service endpoint traffic is not supported.** | It's recommended to use private endpoints for IaaS to PaaS communication. Currently, service endpoint traffic can be denied even when an inbound rule allows 0.0.0.0/0. |

> **Note:**
> Refer to individual PaaS documentation for respective limitations for each service.
