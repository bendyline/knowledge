# Microsoft Foundry SDKs and endpoints


A Foundry resource provides unified access to models, agents, and tools. This article explains which SDK and endpoint to use for your scenario.

The **Foundry SDK** is a thin-client SDK that exposes all of the Foundry project APIs through a single project endpoint. Higher-level SDKs build on it — for example, the Agent Framework `foundry` package depends on the Foundry SDK to access Foundry models, tools, and project configuration.

| SDK | What it's for | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Foundry SDK** | Thin-client SDK over all Foundry project APIs. Access to Foundry Models and platform tools (file search, code interpreter, web search, memory, SharePoint, WorkIQ, Fabric IQ, MCP). | `https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>` |
| **Agent Framework** | Unified multi-agent orchestration for hosted agents and multi-agent systems, available in C#/.NET and Python. The `foundry` package depends on the Foundry SDK for project access. | Responses API in the project endpoint, via `FoundryChatClient`. |
| **OpenAI SDK** | Full OpenAI API surface, including embeddings and Foundry Models sold by Azure through Chat Completions. Best latency and maximum OpenAI compatibility. | `https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1` |
| **Anthropic SDK** | Anthropic Claude models deployed in Foundry. | `https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic` |
| **Foundry Tools SDKs** | Prebuilt solutions (Vision, Speech, Content Safety, and more). | Tool-specific endpoints. |

**Choose your SDK**:
- Use **Foundry SDK** when building apps with agents, evaluations, or Foundry-specific features
- Use **Agent Framework** for hosted agents or multi-agent systems in code using the Responses API in C#/.NET or Python
- Use **OpenAI SDK** when maximum OpenAI compatibility or lowest latency is required, when generating embeddings, or when using Models sold by Azure through Chat Completions
- Use **Anthropic SDK** when working with Anthropic Claude models deployed in Foundry
- Use **Foundry Tools SDKs** when working with specific AI services (Vision, Speech, Language, etc.)

> **Note:**
> **Resource types:** A Foundry resource provides all endpoints previously listed. An Azure OpenAI resource provides only the `/openai/v1` endpoint.
>
> **Authentication:** Samples here use Microsoft Entra ID (`DefaultAzureCredential`). API keys work on `/openai/v1`. Pass the key as `api_key` instead of a token provider.

## Prerequisites

- 
An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free Azure account, which includes a free trial subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn). 


- Have the Azure RBAC role required for your task at the narrowest scope:
  - **Foundry User** on the Foundry project for day-to-day development.

    
> **Important:**
> The Foundry RBAC roles were recently renamed. **Foundry User**, **Foundry Owner**, **Foundry Account Owner**, and **Foundry Project Manager** were previously named Azure AI User, Azure AI Owner, Azure AI Account Owner, and Azure AI Project Manager. You might still see the previous names in some places while the rename rolls out. The role IDs and core permissions are unchanged by the rename.

  - **Foundry Project Manager** on the Foundry project to manage an existing project and its connections.
  - **Foundry Account Owner** on the Foundry resource to create projects or manage account-level resources. Assign this role on the target resource group only when you need to create a Foundry resource.

    Activate the resource-group assignment just in time through Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM), and deactivate it after provisioning. Day-to-day developers and runtime users don't need this elevated assignment.
  
  For details on each role's permissions, see [Role-based access control for Microsoft Foundry](../../concepts/rbac-foundry.md).

- Install the required language runtimes, global tools, and VS Code extensions as described in [Prepare your development environment](install-cli-sdk.md).

### Verify prerequisites

Before proceeding, confirm each check returns the stated result:

- Confirm that the Azure CLI uses the intended subscription and tenant:

  ```azurecli
  az account show --query "{subscription:name, tenant:tenantId}" --output table
  ```

  The command exits successfully and displays the expected subscription and tenant.

- Confirm that your local credential can request a Foundry access token without displaying the token:

  ```azurecli
  az account get-access-token --resource https://ai.azure.com --query expiresOn --output tsv
  ```

  The command exits successfully and displays the token expiration time. If it fails, run `az login` with an identity that has the required Foundry role.

- Confirm that you have the required RBAC role in the Azure portal under **Foundry resource** > **Access control (IAM)**.
**Applies to: programming-language-python**

- Run `python --version`. The command exits successfully and reports Python 3.10 or later.

**Applies to: programming-language-javascript**

- Run `node --version`. The command exits successfully and reports Node.js 22 or later.

**Applies to: programming-language-csharp**

- Run `dotnet --version`. The command exits successfully and reports .NET 8 or later.

**Applies to: programming-language-java**

- Run `java --version`. The command exits successfully and reports Java 17 or later.


- Confirm that your project endpoint has this format:
  `https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>`.

- Confirm that the `gpt-5-mini` deployment is ready:

  ```azurecli
  az cognitiveservices account deployment show \
    --name <resource-name> \
    --resource-group <resource-group> \
    --deployment-name gpt-5-mini \
    --query properties.provisioningState \
    --output tsv
  ```

  The command returns `Succeeded`. Use the deployed name in the code examples if your deployment has a different name.


## Foundry SDK

The Foundry SDK is a thin-client SDK that gives you access to all of the Foundry project APIs through a single project endpoint:

```
https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>
```

It's the foundation other Foundry-aware SDKs build on. For example, the Agent Framework `foundry` package takes a dependency on the Foundry SDK and uses it to access Foundry functionality — you don't need to wire up the project endpoint or OpenAI-compatible client yourself when you use `FoundryChatClient`.

> **Note:**
> If your organization uses a custom subdomain, replace `<resource-name>` with `<your-custom-subdomain>` in the endpoint URL.

This approach simplifies application configuration. Instead of managing multiple endpoints, you configure one.

### Install the Foundry SDK

**Applies to: programming-language-python**




| SDK Version | Portal Version | Status | Python Package |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2.x | Foundry (new) | Stable | `azure-ai-projects>=2.3.0` |
| 1.x | Foundry (classic) | Stable | `azure-ai-projects==1.0.0` |

The [Azure AI Projects client library for Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ai-projects-readme) is a unified library that enables you to use multiple client libraries together by connecting to a single project endpoint. Starting in version 2.3.0, hosted-agent and toolbox operations use stable clients instead of beta namespaces.

The 2.x SDK samples require Python 3.10 or later and `openai>=3.0.0`.


Run this command to install the packages for Foundry projects.
```bash
pip install "azure-ai-projects>=2.3.0" "openai>=3.0.0"
```


**Applies to: programming-language-java**


| SDK Version | Portal Version | Status | Java Package |

The [Azure AI Projects client library for .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.projects-readme) is a unified library that enables you to use multiple client libraries together by connecting to a single project endpoint.

Run these commands to add the required packages to your .NET project.

```bash
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Projects
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Projects.Agents
dotnet add package Azure.AI.Extensions.OpenAI
dotnet add package Azure.Identity
```


### Make your first Foundry SDK call

The SDK exposes two client types because Foundry and OpenAI have different API shapes:

- **Project client** – Use for Foundry-native operations where OpenAI has no equivalent. Examples: listing connections, retrieving project properties, enabling tracing.
- **OpenAI-compatible client** – Use for Foundry functionality that builds on OpenAI concepts. The Responses API, agents, evaluations, and fine-tuning all use OpenAI-style request/response patterns. This client targets the Responses API in your project endpoint, which gives you access to Foundry Models sold by Azure, other models from the catalog, and platform tools. These tools include file search, code interpreter, web search, memory, SharePoint, WorkIQ, Fabric IQ, and MCP servers. The project endpoint serves this traffic on the `/openai` route.

Most apps use both clients. Use the project client for setup and configuration, then use the OpenAI-compatible client for running agents, evaluations, and calling models.

**Applies to: programming-language-python**


```python
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential

project_endpoint = (
    "https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>"
)

project = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=project_endpoint,
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)
openai = project.get_openai_client()
response = openai.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    input="What is the size of France in square miles?",
)
print(f"Response output: {response.output_text}")

> **Note:**
> In newer SDK versions, operations such as evaluation and data-generation job creation are long-running operations that return a poller instead of a result. See the feature-specific how-to and reference pages, such as [Run batch evaluations](../../observability/how-to/cloud-evaluation.md), for the polling patterns used with each SDK.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication errors

If you see `DefaultAzureCredential failed to retrieve a token`:

1. **Verify Azure CLI is authenticated**:
   ```bash
   az account show
   az login  # if not logged in
   ```

2. **Check RBAC role assignment**:
   - Confirm you have at least the Foundry User role on the Foundry project

     
> **Important:**
> The Foundry RBAC roles were recently renamed. **Foundry User**, **Foundry Owner**, **Foundry Account Owner**, and **Foundry Project Manager** were previously named Azure AI User, Azure AI Owner, Azure AI Account Owner, and Azure AI Project Manager. You might still see the previous names in some places while the rename rolls out. The role IDs and core permissions are unchanged by the rename.

   - See [Assign Azure roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal)

3. **For managed identity in production**:
   - Ensure the managed identity has the appropriate role assigned
   - See [Configure managed identities](../../concepts/authentication-authorization-foundry.md#identity-types)

### Endpoint configuration errors

If you see `Connection refused` or `404 Not Found`:

- **Verify resource and project names** match your actual deployment
- **Check endpoint URL format**: Should be `https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project-name>`
- **For custom subdomains**: Replace `<resource-name>` with your custom subdomain

### SDK version mismatches

If code samples fail with `AttributeError` or `ModuleNotFoundError`:

- **Check SDK version**:
  ```bash
  pip show azure-ai-projects  # Python
  npm list @azure/ai-projects  # JavaScript
  dotnet list package  # .NET
  ```

- **Reinstall with correct version flags**: See installation commands in each language section above


## OpenAI SDK

Use the OpenAI SDK when you want the full OpenAI API surface, the best latency, and maximum compatibility with existing OpenAI clients. This endpoint exposes the Responses API on Azure OpenAI directly and provides access to Azure OpenAI models and models sold by Azure, including embeddings, chat completions, and image generation. It doesn't provide access to Foundry-specific features like agents, evaluations, or Foundry-exclusive platform tools. For those features, use the Responses API in your project endpoint through the [Foundry SDK](#foundry-sdk).

> **Tip:**
> Use the OpenAI SDK endpoint for [generating embeddings](../../openai/how-to/embeddings.md). The project endpoint used by the Foundry SDK doesn't currently route embedding requests.

The following snippet shows how to use the Azure OpenAI `/openai/v1` endpoint directly.

**Applies to: programming-language-python**


```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider
from openai import OpenAI

token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
    DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://ai.azure.com/.default"
)
openai_endpoint = "https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/"

openai = OpenAI(
    base_url=openai_endpoint,
    api_key=token_provider,
)
response = openai.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5-mini",
    input="What is the size of France in square miles?",
)
print(f"Response output: {response.output_text}")
```

```output
Response output: <model response>
```

## Anthropic SDK

Use the Anthropic SDK to work with Anthropic Claude models deployed in Foundry. Claude models use a separate `/anthropic` endpoint and the Anthropic Messages API, not the OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

The Anthropic endpoint appends `/anthropic` to your resource URL:

```
https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic
```

The Messages API is available at:

```
https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic/v1/messages
```

**Applies to: programming-language-python**


```python
from anthropic import AnthropicFoundry
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, get_bearer_token_provider

token_provider = get_bearer_token_provider(
    DefaultAzureCredential(), "https://ai.azure.com/.default"
)

client = AnthropicFoundry(
    azure_ad_token_provider=token_provider,
    base_url="https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic",
)

message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",  # Replace with your deployment name
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What are 3 things to visit in Seattle?"}
    ],
    max_tokens=1048,
)

print(f"Response output: {message.content[0].text}")
```

```output
Response output: <model response>
```



**Applies to: programming-language-csharp**


The Anthropic SDK doesn't provide a native C# client. Use the REST API with `HttpClient` to call Claude models.

```csharp
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Text;
using System.Text.Json;
using Azure.Identity;
string endpoint =
    "https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic/v1/messages";
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
var token = await credential.GetTokenAsync(
    new Azure.Core.TokenRequestContext(["https://ai.azure.com/.default"]));
using var httpClient = new HttpClient();
httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
    new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token.Token);
httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("anthropic-version", "2023-06-01");
var requestBody = new
{
    model = "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    messages = new[]
    {
        new { role = "user", content = "Name three Seattle attractions." }
    },
    max_tokens = 1048
};
var anthropicResponse = await httpClient.PostAsync(
    endpoint,
    new StringContent(
        JsonSerializer.Serialize(requestBody), Encoding.UTF8,
        "application/json"));

string result = await anthropicResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
Console.WriteLine(result);
```

```output
<JSON response body containing the model response>
```



**Applies to: programming-language-javascript**


```javascript
import AnthropicFoundry from "@anthropic-ai/foundry-sdk";
import {
    DefaultAzureCredential,

```java
import com.azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder;
import com.azure.core.credential.TokenRequestContext;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;

String endpoint =
    "https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic/v1/messages";
var credential = new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder().build();
var token = credential.getToken(new TokenRequestContext()
    .addScopes("https://ai.azure.com/.default")).block();
String requestBody = """
    {"model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
        "messages": [{"role": "user",
            "content": "What are 3 things to visit in Seattle?"}],
        "max_tokens": 1048}
    """;
HttpClient httpClient = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create(endpoint))
    .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + token.getToken())
    .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
    .header("anthropic-version", "2023-06-01")
    .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(requestBody))
    .build();

HttpResponse<String> anthropicResponse = httpClient.send(
    request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
System.out.println(anthropicResponse.body());
```

```output
<JSON response body containing the model response>
```

## Agent Framework

[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview) is an open-source SDK for C#/.NET and Python that provides unified multi-agent orchestration and consistent abstractions for building agents and multi-agent systems. It's the recommended orchestration layer for [Hosted agents](../../agents/overview.md#hosted-agents) in Foundry.

- If you previously used AutoGen or Semantic Kernel for multi-agent orchestration (coordinating multiple agents to work together on tasks), consider Agent Framework as your primary orchestration layer. It helps you avoid combining multiple orchestration SDKs that solve similar coordination tasks, which can add conflicting abstractions and dependencies.
- If you already have substantial existing orchestration code, depend on product-specific features, or face complex migration requirements, evaluate those requirements before consolidating on Agent Framework.

### Run your code as a Hosted agent

The main story for code-based agents in Foundry is [Hosted agents](../../agents/overview.md#hosted-agents). Write your agent with Agent Framework, package it as a container image or zip of your source code, and let Foundry run it with a managed endpoint, automatic scaling on isolated Micro VMs, a dedicated Microsoft Entra agent identity, session-level state, and end-to-end observability.

Hosted agents are the recommended path when you want a Foundry-managed, network-addressable endpoint that other apps or agents can call. See [Deploy your first Hosted agent](../../agents/quickstarts/quickstart-hosted-agent.md).

### Build agents in code outside Foundry with the Responses API

If you're hosting your agent outside of Foundry — in your own process or infrastructure — you can also use Agent Framework to call the **Responses API in your project endpoint** directly. Agent Framework connects through the `FoundryChatClient` provider, which targets:

```
{project_endpoint}/openai/v1/responses
```

Going through the project endpoint — instead of a resource-level OpenAI endpoint — gives your agent:

- Foundry models from the catalog (Azure OpenAI and Foundry direct models) through one API.
- Platform tools beyond the OpenAI tool set, including file search, code interpreter, memory, web search, MCP servers, SharePoint, WorkIQ, and Fabric IQ.
- Project-scoped data, On-Behalf-Of (OBO) tool authentication, and the project's tracing, content filters, and identity configuration.

This pattern is additive to Hosted agents, not an alternative — the same Agent Framework code can call the Responses API from your own process today and be packaged as a Hosted agent later when you want a Foundry-managed endpoint. See [Quickstart: Build agents using the Responses API](../../agents/quickstarts/responses-api.md).

For a full comparison of agent types and hosting choices, see [What is Microsoft Foundry Agent Service?](../../agents/overview.md).

## Foundry Tools SDKs

Foundry Tools (formerly Azure AI Services) are prebuilt point solutions with dedicated SDKs. Use the following endpoints to work with Foundry Tools.

### Which endpoint should you use?

Choose an endpoint based on your needs:

Use the Azure AI Services endpoint to access Computer Vision, Content Safety, Document Intelligence, Language, Translation, and Token Foundry Tools.

Foundry Tools endpoint: `https://<your-resource-name>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/`

> **Note:**
> Endpoints use either your resource name or a custom subdomain. If your organization set up a custom subdomain, replace `your-resource-name` with `your-custom-subdomain` in all endpoint examples.

If your workloads use retiring Azure AI Language features—for example, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, summarization, entity linking, CLU, or CQA—plan to migrate to Microsoft Foundry alternatives. For new development, consider using the Foundry SDK or the OpenAI-compatible endpoint as described earlier in this article. See [Migrate from Language Studio to Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/language-service/migration-studio-to-foundry).

For Speech and Translation Foundry Tools, use the endpoints in the following tables. Replace placeholders with your resource information.

#### Speech Endpoints

| Foundry Tool | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Speech to Text (Standard) | `https://<YOUR-RESOURCE-REGION>.stt.speech.microsoft.com` |
| Text to Speech (Neural) | `https://<YOUR-RESOURCE-REGION>.tts.speech.microsoft.com` |
| Custom Voice | `https://<YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/` |

#### Translation Endpoints

| Foundry Tool | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Text Translation | `https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/` |
| Document Translation | `https://<YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/` |

#### Language Endpoints

| Foundry Tool | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Text analysis | `https://<YOUR-RESOURCE-NAME>.cognitiveservices.azure.com` |

> **Important:**
> On March 20, 2027, Azure Language Studio will retire and migrate to Microsoft Foundry; all capabilities and future enhancements will be available in Microsoft Foundry.
>
> On March 31, 2029, the following Azure Language capabilities will retire (end of support). Before that date, users should migrate existing workloads and onboard new projects to [Microsoft Foundry models](../../concepts/foundry-models-overview.md) for enhanced natural language understanding and simplified application integration:
>
> - Key Phrase Extraction
> - Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining
> - Custom Text Classification
> - Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)
> - Custom Question Answering (CQA)
> - Orchestration Workflow
> - Summarization (extractive and abstractive, for documents and conversations)
> - Entity Linking
>
> Core features with continued support: Language Detection, PII Detection, Text Analytics for Health, Prebuilt NER, and Custom NER.
>
> For migration options, see [Migrate from Language Studio to Microsoft Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/language-service/migration-studio-to-foundry).
