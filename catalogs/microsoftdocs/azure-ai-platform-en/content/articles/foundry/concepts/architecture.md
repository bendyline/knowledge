# Microsoft Foundry architecture
Microsoft Foundry organizes AI workloads through a layered architecture: a top-level Foundry resource for governance, projects for development isolation, and connected Azure services for storage, search, and secrets management.

This article provides IT operations and security teams with details on the Foundry resource and underlying Azure service architecture, its components, and its relation with other Azure resource types. Use this information to guide how to [customize](../how-to/configure-private-link.md) your Foundry deployment to your organization's requirements. For more information on how to roll out Foundry in your organization, see [Foundry Rollout](planning.md).


## When to use this architecture

Consider the Foundry resource model when your scenario involves:

- **First-time setup**: You're starting a new AI project and want a single resource that bundles model access, agent hosting, and evaluation tooling.
- **Multi-team access**: Multiple teams need isolated projects with shared model deployments and centralized governance.
- **Compliance-driven design**: Your organization requires private networking, customer-managed encryption, or Azure RBAC scoping at both resource and project levels.
- **Azure OpenAI migration**: You're moving from a standalone Azure OpenAI resource and want to keep existing policies and RBAC while adding agent and evaluation capabilities.

For single-developer exploration, a Foundry resource with one project is the recommended default. If your workload only requires Azure OpenAI completions without agent hosting or evaluation, a standalone Azure OpenAI resource might be sufficient.

## Azure AI resource types and providers

Within the Azure AI product family, you can use these [Azure resource providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types) that support user needs at different layers in the stack.

| Resource provider | Purpose | Supported services |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft.CognitiveServices | Supports Agentic and GenAI application development composing and customizing prebuilt models. | Foundry; Azure OpenAI; Azure Speech in Foundry Tools; Azure Language in Foundry Tools; Azure Vision in Foundry Tools |
| Microsoft.Search | Supports knowledge retrieval over your data | Azure AI Search |

For most AI development scenarios—including agent building, model deployment, and evaluation workflows—the Foundry resource is the recommended starting point. Foundry resources share the Microsoft.CognitiveServices provider namespace with services such as Azure OpenAI, Speech, Vision, and Language. This shared provider namespace helps align management APIs, access control patterns, networking, and policy behavior across related AI resources.

Use the following table to identify which resource type matches your workload. It shows the specific resource types and capabilities within the Microsoft.CognitiveServices provider:



| Resource type | Resource provider and type | Kind | Supported capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Foundry | `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` | `AIServices` | Agents, Evaluations, Azure OpenAI, Speech, Vision, Language, and Content Understanding |
| Foundry project | `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/projects` | `AIServices` | **Subresource to the above** |
| Azure Speech in Foundry Tools | `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` | `Speech` | Speech |
| Azure Language in Foundry Tools | `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` | `Language` | Language |
| Azure Vision in Foundry Tools | `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts` | `Vision` | Vision |


Resource types under the same provider namespaces share the same management APIs, and use similar [Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) actions, networking configurations, and aliases for Azure Policy configuration. If you're upgrading from Azure OpenAI to Foundry, your existing custom Azure policies and Azure RBAC actions continue to apply.


## Foundry resource hierarchy

The following diagram shows a Foundry resource with model deployments, security settings, connections, and two projects. Connected Azure services such as Storage, Key Vault, and Azure AI Search are separate Azure resources under their own governance boundaries:

> **Important:**
> Connected resources like Storage, Key Vault, and Azure AI Search are independent Azure resources with their own governance boundaries. You manage networking, access policies, and compliance settings for these resources separately from the Foundry resource.

Use this model when planning architecture and access boundaries:

- **Foundry resource**: Top-level Azure resource where you manage governance settings such as networking, security, and model deployments.
- **Project**: Development boundary inside the Foundry resource where teams build and evaluate use cases. Projects let teams prototype within a preconfigured environment, reusing existing model deployments and connections without repeated IT setup.
- **Project assets**: Files, agents, evaluations, and related artifacts scoped to a project.
- **Connected resources**: Azure services such as Storage, Key Vault, and Azure AI Search that the Foundry resource references through connections. These resources have separate governance boundaries, so you manage their networking and access policies independently.

This separation lets IT teams apply centralized controls at the resource level while development teams work within project-level boundaries.

> **Note:**
> Most new APIs are available at the project scope. However, some capabilities originally supported at the account level through Azure OpenAI, Speech, Vision, and Language services are available only at the Foundry resource level, not at the project scope. For example, the Translator API is available only from the Foundry resource level. Plan your deployment structure based on which API scopes your workloads require.

## Security-driven separation of concerns

Foundry enforces a clear separation between management and development operations to ensure secure and scalable AI workloads.

### Top-level resource governance

The top-level Foundry resource scopes management operations such as configuring security, establishing connectivity with other Azure services, and managing deployments. Dedicated project containers isolate development activities and provide boundaries for access control, files, agents, and evaluations.

### Role-based access control

Azure RBAC actions reflect this separation of concerns. Control plane actions, such as creating deployments and projects, are distinct from data plane actions, such as building agents, running evaluations, and uploading files. You can scope RBAC assignments at both the top-level resource and individual project level. Assign [managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) at either scope to support secure automation and service access. For more information, see [Role-based access control for Microsoft Foundry](rbac-foundry.md).

Common starter assignments for least-privilege onboarding include:

- **Foundry User** for each developer user principal at the Foundry resource scope.

  
> **Important:**
> The Foundry RBAC roles were recently renamed. **Foundry User**, **Foundry Owner**, **Foundry Account Owner**, and **Foundry Project Manager** were previously named Azure AI User, Azure AI Owner, Azure AI Account Owner, and Azure AI Project Manager. You might still see the previous names in some places while the rename rolls out. The role IDs and core permissions are unchanged by the rename.

- **Foundry User** for each project managed identity at the Foundry resource scope.

For role definitions and scope planning guidance, see [Role-based access control for Microsoft Foundry](rbac-foundry.md).

## Monitoring and observability

Azure Monitor segments metrics by scope. You can view management and usage metrics at the top-level resource, while project-specific metrics, such as evaluation performance or agent activity, are scoped to the individual project containers.

Key monitoring capabilities include:

- **Resource-level metrics**: Token consumption, model latency, request counts, and error rates across all projects.
- **Project-level metrics**: Evaluation run outcomes, agent invocation counts, and file operation activity.
- **Diagnostic logging**: Enable diagnostic settings to route logs to Log Analytics, Storage, or Event Hubs for analysis and retention.

For more information, see [Azure Monitor overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/overview).


## Computing infrastructure

Foundry manages compute infrastructure for model hosting, agent execution, and batch processing. This section covers deployment types, agent and evaluation infrastructure, virtual network integration, tenant isolation, content safety controls, and regional availability.

### Model deployment types

Foundry supports multiple deployment types for model hosting, grouped by data-processing scope: global (cross-region), data zone (within a defined boundary), and regional (single region). Each type balances latency, throughput, and data-processing location differently:

| Deployment type | Data processing | Billing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Global Standard | Cross-region, Azure-managed | Pay-per-token |
| Global Provisioned | Cross-region, Azure-managed | Hourly reserved capacity |
| Global Batch | Cross-region, Azure-managed | Batch token pricing |
| Data Zone Standard | Within data-zone boundary | Pay-per-token |
| Data Zone Provisioned | Within data-zone boundary | Hourly reserved capacity |
| Data Zone Batch | Within data-zone boundary | Batch token pricing |
| Standard | Single region | Pay-per-token |
| Regional Provisioned | Single region | Hourly reserved capacity |
| Developer | Any Azure region (no data residency guarantee) | Pay-per-token (fine-tuned model evaluation only; 24-hour lifetime; no SLA) |

For details on how to choose the right deployment type, see [Deployment types for Foundry Models](../foundry-models/concepts/deployment-types.md).

Voice-based prompt agents also support voice-native model patterns. A speech-to-speech model, such as GPT-Realtime, processes audio input and produces spoken output in one model. A cascaded voice experience uses separate speech recognition, text-model, and speech synthesis stages. Choose the pattern based on your latency, model, voice, and language requirements. The available models and regions depend on the selected Foundry model deployment.

### Agents, evaluations, and batch processing

Agents, evaluations, and batch jobs are fully managed by Microsoft. Agent workloads run inside the platform's container infrastructure, which supports [virtual network integration](#virtual-network-integration) for network-isolated scenarios. Evaluations invoke model endpoints, compare outputs against grading criteria, and store results within the project scope. Batch processing queues inference requests for asynchronous execution at reduced per-token pricing. Results for all three workload types are accessible through the portal or SDK.

### Virtual network integration

When your agents connect with external systems, you can isolate network traffic using [container injection](../agents/how-to/virtual-networks.md), where the platform injects a subnet into your virtual network, enabling local communication with your Azure resources within the same virtual network.

Foundry supports two networking models for outbound isolation:

| Model | How it works | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Customer-managed VNet (BYO)** | You provide the VNet and a dedicated subnet delegated to `Microsoft.App/environments`. The platform injects into your subnet, enabling local communication with your private Azure resources. | Full control over network configuration; requires your own network management. |
| **Managed VNet** | Foundry manages the VNet on your behalf. | Simpler setup; limits customization options. For details, see [Configure managed virtual network](../how-to/managed-virtual-network.md). |

> **Note:**
> Some network-isolated scenarios require the SDK or CLI instead of the portal. For example, deployments with private endpoints that block all public access aren't configurable through the portal UI. For details, see [How to configure a private link for Foundry](../how-to/configure-private-link.md).

### Tenant isolation

Workloads run in logically isolated environments per Foundry resource. Customer code doesn't share runtime containers with other tenants.

### Content safety and guardrails

Foundry integrates content safety controls into the model and agent inference pipeline. Guardrails define risks to detect, intervention points to scan, and response actions when a risk is detected. Intervention points include user input, output, tool calls (preview), and tool responses (preview). Content filters run inline with model requests and can be configured per deployment. For more information, see [Guardrails and controls overview](../guardrails/guardrails-overview.md) and [Content filtering severity levels](../openai/concepts/content-filter-severity-levels.md).

### Regional availability

Compute capabilities vary by Azure region. Model availability, deployment type options, and feature support such as Agents or evaluations might differ across regions. Confirm that your target region supports the required capabilities before provisioning. For current availability, see [Feature availability across cloud regions](../reference/region-support.md).


## Data storage

Foundry provides flexible and secure data storage options to support a wide range of AI workloads.

### Managed storage for file upload

In the default setup, Foundry uses Microsoft-managed storage accounts that are logically separated and support direct file uploads for select use cases, such as OpenAI models and Agents, without requiring a customer-provided storage account.

### Bring your own storage

You can optionally connect your own Azure Storage accounts. Foundry tools such as evaluations and batch processing can read inputs from and write outputs to these accounts. For details on supported scenarios, see [Bring-your-own resources with the Agent service](../agents/how-to/use-your-own-resources.md).

### Agent state storage

- With the [basic agent setup](../agents/how-to/use-your-own-resources.md), the Agent service stores threads, messages, and files in Microsoft-managed multitenant storage, with logical separation.
- With the [standard agent setup](../agents/how-to/use-your-own-resources.md), you bring your own Azure resources for all customer data—including files, conversations, and vector stores. In this configuration, data is isolated by project within your storage accounts.

### Customer-managed key encryption

By default, Azure services encrypt data at rest and in transit using Microsoft-managed keys with FIPS 140-2 compliant 256-bit AES encryption. No code changes are required.

To use your own keys instead, confirm these prerequisites before enabling customer-managed keys for Foundry:

- Key Vault is deployed in the same Azure region as your Foundry resource.
- Soft delete and purge protection are enabled on Key Vault.
- Managed identities have required key permissions, such as the **Key Vault Crypto User** role when using Azure RBAC.

### Bring your own Key Vault

By default, Foundry stores all API key-based connection secrets in a managed Azure Key Vault. If you prefer to manage secrets yourself, connect your key vault to the Foundry resource. One Azure Key Vault connection manages all project and resource level connection secrets. For more information, see [how to set up an Azure Key Vault connection to Foundry](../how-to/set-up-key-vault-connection.md).

To learn more about data encryption, see [customer-managed keys for encryption with Foundry](customer-managed-keys.md).

### Data residency and compliance

Foundry stores all data at rest in the designated Azure geography. Inferencing data (prompts and completions) is processed according to the deployment type: global deployments might route to any Azure region, data zone deployments stay within the US or EU zone, and standard or regional deployments process in the deployment region. For details, see [Deployment types](../foundry-models/concepts/deployment-types.md). Foundry doesn't support automatic cross-region failover. If your organization requires multi-region availability, deploy separate Foundry resources in each target region and manage data synchronization and routing at the application layer. For compliance certification details, see [Azure compliance documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/).

## Validate architecture decisions

Before rollout, validate the following for your target environment:

- Verify that required models and features are available in your deployment regions. For details, see [Feature availability across cloud regions](../reference/region-support.md).
- Check that role assignments are scoped correctly at both the Foundry resource and project levels. For details, see [Role-based access control for Microsoft Foundry](rbac-foundry.md).
- Validate network isolation requirements and private access paths. For details, see [How to configure a private link for Foundry](../how-to/configure-private-link.md).
- Confirm encryption and secret-management requirements, including customer-managed keys and Azure Key Vault integration. For details, see [Customer-managed keys for encryption with Foundry](customer-managed-keys.md) and [how to set up an Azure Key Vault connection to Foundry](../how-to/set-up-key-vault-connection.md).
- Review quotas and limits for your target resources, including model deployment limits and rate limits. For details, see [Azure OpenAI quotas and limits](../openai/quotas-limits.md) and [Agent Service limits, quotas, and regions](../agents/concepts/limits-quotas-regions.md).
