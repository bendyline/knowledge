## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later installed.


## Samples repository

The complete sample code for this article is available in the [foundry-samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples). To clone the repository and navigate to the sample use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples.git
cd foundry-samples/samples/python/foundry-local/native-chat-completions
```

## Install packages


If you're developing or shipping on Windows, select the **Windows** tab. The Windows package integrates with the [Windows ML](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview) runtime — it provides the same API surface area with a wider breadth of hardware acceleration.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```bash
pip install foundry-local-sdk-winml openai
```

### [Cross-Platform](#tab/xplatform)

```bash
pip install foundry-local-sdk openai
```

## Use native chat completions API    

Copy and paste the following code into a Python file named `app.py`:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: ~/foundry-local-main/samples/python/foundry-local/native-chat-completions/src/app.py](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/766e4b444667054247ad440e9c5a418efa71c050/articles/foundry-local/includes/native-chat-completions/python.md)

Run the code by using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'foundry_local_sdk'`**: Install the SDK by running `pip install foundry-local-sdk`.
- **`Model not found`**: Run the optional model listing snippet to find an alias available on your device, then update the alias passed to `get_model`.
- **Slow first run**: Model downloads can take time the first time you run the app.
