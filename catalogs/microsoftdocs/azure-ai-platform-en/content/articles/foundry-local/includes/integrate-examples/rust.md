## Prerequisites

- [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed.


## Samples repository

The complete sample code for this article is available in the [foundry-samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples). To clone the repository and navigate to the sample use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft-foundry/foundry-samples.git
cd foundry-samples/samples/rust/foundry-local/foundry-local-webserver
```

## Install packages


If you're developing or shipping on Windows, select the **Windows** tab. The Windows package integrates with the [Windows ML](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/ai/new-windows-ml/overview) runtime — it provides the same API surface area with a wider breadth of hardware acceleration.

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```bash
cargo add foundry-local-sdk --features winml
cargo add tokio --features full
cargo add tokio-stream anyhow
```

### [Cross-Platform](#tab/xplatform)

```bash
cargo add foundry-local-sdk
cargo add tokio --features full
cargo add tokio-stream anyhow
```

## Update the `main.rs` file

Copy-and-paste the following code into the Rust file named `main.rs`:

[Code reference unavailable in this source snapshot: ~/foundry-local-main/samples/rust/foundry-local/foundry-local-webserver/src/main.rs](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/766e4b444667054247ad440e9c5a418efa71c050/articles/foundry-local/includes/integrate-examples/rust.md)

Reference: [Foundry Local SDK reference](../../reference/reference-sdk-current.md)
Reference: [Foundry Local REST API reference](../../reference/reference-rest.md)

Run the code using the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

You should see a streaming response printed in your terminal. On the first run, Foundry Local might download execution providers and the model, which can take a few minutes.
