[Reference documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/) | [Package (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk) | [Additional samples on GitHub](https://aka.ms/speech/github-javascript) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js)



In this quickstart, you run an application for speech to text transcription with real-time diarization. Diarization distinguishes between the different speakers who participate in the conversation. The Speech service provides information about which speaker was speaking a particular part of transcribed speech. 

The speaker information is included in the result in the speaker ID field. The speaker ID is a generic identifier assigned to each conversation participant by the service during the recognition as different speakers are being identified from the provided audio content.

> **Tip:**
> For fast transcription of audio files, consider using the [fast transcription API.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/fast-transcription-create) Fast transcription API supports features such as language identification and diarization. 


## Prerequisites


> 
> - An Azure subscription. You can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
> - [Create a Foundry resource for Speech](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesAIFoundry) in the Azure portal.
> - Get the Speech resource key and region. After your Speech resource is deployed, select **Go to resource** to view and manage keys.


## Setup

1. Create a new folder `transcription-quickstart` and go to the quickstart folder with the following command:

    ```shell
    mkdir transcription-quickstart && cd transcription-quickstart
    ```
    
1. Create the `package.json` with the following command:

    ```shell
    npm init -y
    ```

1. Update the `package.json` to ECMAScript with the following command:
    ```shell
    npm pkg set type=module
    ```

1. Install the Speech SDK for JavaScript with:

    ```console
    npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk
    ```

1. You need to install the Node.js type definitions to avoid TypeScript errors. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    npm install --save-dev @types/node
    ```

### Retrieve resource information


You need to authenticate your application to access Foundry Tools. This article shows you how to use environment variables to store your credentials. You can then access the environment variables from your code to authenticate your application. For production, use a more secure way to store and access your credentials. 

[Include unavailable in this source snapshot: ~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/ai-services/security/microsoft-entra-id-akv-expanded.md](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/766e4b444667054247ad440e9c5a418efa71c050/articles/ai-services/speech-service/includes/quickstarts/stt-diarization/typescript.md)

To set the environment variables for your Speech resource key and region, open a console window, and follow the instructions for your operating system and development environment.

- To set the `SPEECH_KEY` environment variable, replace *your-key* with one of the keys for your resource.
- To set the `SPEECH_REGION` environment variable, replace *your-region* with one of the regions for your resource.
- To set the `ENDPOINT` environment variable, replace `your-endpoint` with the actual endpoint of your Speech resource.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx SPEECH_KEY your-key
setx SPEECH_REGION your-region
setx ENDPOINT your-endpoint
```

> **Note:**
> If you only need to access the environment variables in the current console, you can set the environment variable with `set` instead of `setx`.

After you add the environment variables, you might need to restart any programs that need to read the environment variables, including the console window. For example, if you're using Visual Studio as your editor, restart Visual Studio before you run the example.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

##### Bash

Edit your *.bashrc* file, and add the environment variables:

```bash
export SPEECH_KEY=your-key
export SPEECH_REGION=your-region
export ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.

#### [macOS](#tab/macos)

##### Bash

Edit your *.bash_profile* file, and add the environment variables:

```bash
export SPEECH_KEY=your-key
export SPEECH_REGION=your-region
export ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bash_profile` from your console window to make the changes effective.

##### Xcode

For iOS and macOS development, you set the environment variables in Xcode. For example, follow these steps to set the environment variable in Xcode 13.4.1.

1. Select **Product** > **Scheme** > **Edit scheme**.
1. Select **Arguments** on the **Run** (Debug Run) page.
1. Under **Environment Variables** select the plus (+) sign to add a new environment variable.
1. Enter `SPEECH_KEY` for the **Name** and enter your Speech resource key for the **Value**.

To set the environment variable for your Speech resource region, follow the same steps. Set `SPEECH_REGION` to the region of your resource. For example, `westus`. Set `ENDPOINT` to the endpoint of your resource

For more configuration options, see [the Xcode documentation](https://help.apple.com/xcode/#/dev745c5c974).

## Implement diarization from file with conversation transcription

Follow these steps to create a new console application for conversation transcription.

1. Create a new file named *transcription.ts* with the following content:

    ```typescript
    import { readFileSync, createReadStream } from "fs";
    import { 
        SpeechConfig, 
        AudioConfig, 
        ConversationTranscriber,
        AudioInputStream 
    } from "microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk";
    
    // This example requires environment variables named "ENDPOINT" and "SPEECH_KEY"
    const speechConfig: SpeechConfig = SpeechConfig.fromEndpoint(new URL(process.env.ENDPOINT!), process.env.SPEECH_KEY!);
    
    function fromFile(): void {
        const filename = "katiesteve.wav";
    
        const audioConfig: AudioConfig = AudioConfig.fromWavFileInput(readFileSync(filename));
        const conversationTranscriber: ConversationTranscriber = new ConversationTranscriber(speechConfig, audioConfig);
    
        const pushStream = AudioInputStream.createPushStream();
    
        createReadStream(filename).on('data', function(chunk: string | Buffer) {
            pushStream.write((chunk as Buffer).slice());
        }).on('end', function() {
            pushStream.close();
        });
    
        console.log("Transcribing from: " + filename);
    
        conversationTranscriber.sessionStarted = function(s, e) {
            console.log("SessionStarted event");
            console.log("SessionId:" + e.sessionId);
        };
        conversationTranscriber.sessionStopped = function(s, e) {
            console.log("SessionStopped event");
            console.log("SessionId:" + e.sessionId);
            conversationTranscriber.stopTranscribingAsync();
        };
        conversationTranscriber.canceled = function(s, e) {
            console.log("Canceled event");
            console.log(e.errorDetails);
            conversationTranscriber.stopTranscribingAsync();
        };
        conversationTranscriber.transcribed = function(s, e) {
            console.log("TRANSCRIBED: Text=" + e.result.text + " Speaker ID=" + e.result.speakerId);
        };
    
        // Start conversation transcription
        conversationTranscriber.startTranscribingAsync(
            function () {},
            function (err) {
                console.trace("err - starting transcription: " + err);
            }
        );
    
    }
    fromFile();
    ```

1. Get the [sample audio file](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/master/sampledata/audiofiles/katiesteve.wav) or use your own `.wav` file. Replace `katiesteve.wav` with the path and name of your `.wav` file.

   The application recognizes speech from multiple participants in the conversation. Your audio file should contain multiple speakers.

1. To change the speech recognition language, replace `en-US` with another [supported language](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/supported-languages). For example, `es-ES` for Spanish (Spain). The default language is `en-US` if you don't specify a language. For details about how to identify one of multiple languages that might be spoken, see [language identification](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/language-identification).

1. Create the `tsconfig.json` file to transpile the TypeScript code and copy the following code for ECMAScript.

    ```json
    {
        "compilerOptions": {
          "module": "NodeNext",
          "target": "ES2022", // Supports top-level await
          "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
          "skipLibCheck": true, // Avoid type errors from node_modules
          "strict": true // Enable strict type-checking options
        },
        "include": ["*.ts"]
    }
    ```

1. Transpile from TypeScript to JavaScript.

    ```shell
    tsc
    ```

    This command should produce no output if successful.

1. Run your new console application to start speech recognition from a file:

   ```console
   node transcription.js
   ```

Wait a few moments to get the response.

## Output

The transcribed conversation should be output as text:

```output
SessionStarted event
SessionId:E87AFBA483C2481985F6C9AF719F616B
TRANSCRIBED: Text=Good morning, Steve. Speaker ID=Unknown
TRANSCRIBED: Text=Good morning, Katie. Speaker ID=Unknown
TRANSCRIBED: Text=Have you tried the latest real time diarization in Microsoft Speech Service which can tell you who said what in real time? Speaker ID=Guest-1
TRANSCRIBED: Text=Not yet. I've been using the batch transcription with diarization functionality, but it produces diarization result until whole audio get processed. Speaker ID=Guest-2
TRANSCRIBED: Text=Is the new feature can diarize in real time? Speaker ID=Guest-2
TRANSCRIBED: Text=Absolutely. Speaker ID=Guest-1
TRANSCRIBED: Text=That's exciting. Let me try it right now. Speaker ID=Guest-2
Canceled event
undefined
SessionStopped event
SessionId:E87AFBA483C2481985F6C9AF719F616B
```

Speakers are identified as Guest-1, Guest-2, and so on, depending on the number of speakers in the conversation.

## Clean up resources


You can use the [Azure portal](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/766e4b444667054247ad440e9c5a418efa71c050/articles/ai-services/speech-service/includes/common/~/articles/ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources) or [Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/766e4b444667054247ad440e9c5a418efa71c050/articles/ai-services/speech-service/includes/common/~/articles/ai-services/multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources) to remove the Speech resource you created.
