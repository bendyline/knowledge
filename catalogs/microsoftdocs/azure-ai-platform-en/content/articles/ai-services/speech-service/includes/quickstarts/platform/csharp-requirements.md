The Speech SDK for C# is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

On Windows, you must use the 64-bit target architecture. Windows 11 or later is required.

Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170\&preserve-view=true) for your platform. Installing this package for the first time might require a restart.

# [Linux](#tab/linux)

The Speech SDK for C# only supports the following distributions on the x64, ARM32, and ARM64 architectures:

- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04
- Debian 11/12
- Amazon Linux 2023
- Azure Linux 3.0


> **Important:**
> Use the most recent LTS release of the Linux distribution. For example, if you are using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, use the latest release of Ubuntu 20.04.X.

The Speech SDK depends on the following Linux system libraries:

- The shared libraries of the GNU C library, including the POSIX Threads Programming library, `libpthreads`.
- The OpenSSL library, version 1.x (`libssl1`) or 3.x (`libssl3`), and certificates (`ca-certificates`).
- The shared library for ALSA applications (`libasound2`).

# [Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04](#tab/ubuntu)

Run these commands:

```Bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential ca-certificates libasound2-dev libssl-dev wget
```

# [Debian 11/12](#tab/debian)

Run these commands:

```Bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential ca-certificates libasound2-dev libssl-dev wget
