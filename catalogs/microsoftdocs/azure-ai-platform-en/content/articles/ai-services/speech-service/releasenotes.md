### Speech SDK 1.31.0: August 2023 release

#### New Features

* Support for [real-time diarization](get-started-stt-diarization.md) is available in public preview with the Speech SDK 1.31.0. This feature is available in the following SDKs: C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and Objective-C/Swift.

* Synchronized speech synthesis word boundary and viseme events with audio playback

#### Breaking changes

- The former "conversation transcription" scenario is renamed to "meeting transcription". For example, use `MeetingTranscriber` instead of `ConversationTranscriber`, and use `CreateMeetingAsync` instead of `CreateConversationAsync`. Although the names of SDK objects and methods have changed, the renaming doesn't change the feature itself. Use meeting transcription objects for transcription of meetings with user profiles and voice signatures. The "conversation translation" objects and methods aren't affected by these changes. You can still use the `ConversationTranslator` object and its methods for meeting translation scenarios.

- For real-time diarization, a new `ConversationTranscriber` object is introduced. The new "conversation transcription" object model and call patterns are similar to continuous recognition with the `SpeechRecognizer` object. A key difference is that the `ConversationTranscriber` object is designed to be used in a conversation scenario where you want to differentiate multiple speakers (diarization). User profiles and voice signatures aren't applicable. See the [real-time diarization quickstart](get-started-stt-diarization.md) for more information.

This table shows the previous and new object names for real-time diarization and meeting transcription. The scenario name is in the first column, the previous object names are in the second column, and the new object names are in the third column. 

| Scenario name | Previous object names | New object names |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real-time diarization | N/A | `ConversationTranscriber` |
| Meeting transcription | `ConversationTranscriber`<br/>`ConversationTranscriptionEventArgs`<br/>`ConversationTranscriptionCanceledEventArgs`<br/>`ConversationTranscriptionResult`<br/>`RemoteConversationTranscriptionResult`<br/>`RemoteConversationTranscriptionClient`<br/>`RemoteConversationTranscriptionResult`<br/>`Participant`<sup>1</sup><br/>`ParticipantChangedReason`<sup>1</sup><br/>`User`<sup>1</sup> | `MeetingTranscriber`<br/>`MeetingTranscriptionEventArgs`<br/>`MeetingTranscriptionCanceledEventArgs`<br/>`MeetingTranscriptionResult`<br/>`RemoteMeetingTranscriptionResult`<br/>`RemoteMeetingTranscriptionClient`<br/>`RemoteMeetingTranscriptionResult`<br/>`Participant`<br/>`ParticipantChangedReason`<br/>`User`<br/>`Meeting`<sup>2</sup> |

<sup>1</sup> The `Participant`, `ParticipantChangedReason`, and `User` objects are applicable to both meeting transcription and meeting translation scenarios.

<sup>2</sup> The `Meeting` object is new and is used with the `MeetingTranscriber` object.

#### Bug fixes

* Fixed macOS minimum supported version https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/2017
* Fixed Pronunciation Assessment bug:
  - Addressed phoneme accuracy scores issue, ensuring they now accurately reflect only the specific mispronounced phoneme. https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1917
  - Resolved an issue where the Pronunciation Assessment feature was inaccurately identifying entirely correct pronunciations as erroneous, particularly in situations where words could have multiple valid pronunciations. https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1530

### Speech SDK 1.30.0: July 2023 release

#### New Features

* **C++, C#, Java** - Added support for `DisplayWords` in Embedded Speech Recognition's detailed result.
* **Objective-C/Swift** - Added support for `ConnectionMessageReceived` event in Objective-C/Swift.
* **Objective-C/Swift** - Improved keyword-spotting models for iOS. This change has increased the size of certain packages, which contain iOS binaries (like NuGet, XCFramework). We're working to reduce the size for future releases.

#### Bug fixes

* Fixed a memory leak when using speech recognizer with PhraseListGrammar, as reported by a customer ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1978)).
* Fixed a deadlock in text to speech open connection API.

#### More notes

* **Java** - Some internally used, `public` Java API methods were changed to package `internal`, `protected` or `private`. This change shouldn't have an effect on developers, as we don't expect applications to be using those. Noted here for transparency.

#### Samples

### Speech SDK 1.28.0: May 2023 release

#### Breaking change

* **JavaScript SDK**: Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) was removed. This allows clients to better conform to browser and Node standards for certificate handling. Version 1.28 and onward will no longer include our custom OCSP module.

#### New Features

* **Embedded Speech Recognition** now returns `NoMatchReason::EndSilenceTimeout` when a silence timeout occurs at the end of an utterance. This matches the behavior when doing recognition using the real-time speech service.
* **JavaScript SDK**: Set properties on `SpeechTranslationConfig` using `PropertyId` enum values.

#### Bug fixes

* **C# on Windows** - Fix potential race condition/deadlock in Windows audio extension. In scenarios that both dispose of the audio renderer quickly and also use the Synthesizer method to stop speaking, the underlying event wasn't reset by stop, and could cause the renderer object to never be disposed, all while it could be holding a global lock for disposal, freezing the dotnet GC thread.

#### Samples

* Added an embedded speech sample for MAUI.
* Updated the embedded speech sample for Android Java to include text to speech.

### Speech SDK 1.27.0: April 2023 release

* **Intent recognition** - Fix Pattern Matcher priorities related to list entities.

#### Samples

* Properly handle authentication failure in C# Conversation Transcription (CTS) sample.
* Added example of streaming pronunciation assessment for Python, JavaScript, Objective-C and Swift.


### Speech SDK 1.26.0: March 2023 release

#### Breaking changes

* Bitcode has been disabled in all iOS targets in the following packages: Cocoapod with xcframework, NuGet (for Xamarin and MAUI) and Unity. The change is due to Apple's deprecation of bitcode support from Xcode 14 and onwards. This change also means if you're using Xcode 13 version or you have explicitly enabled the bitcode on your application using the Speech SDK, you might encounter an error saying "framework doesn't contain bitcode and you must rebuild it". To resolve this issue, make sure your targets have bitcode disabled.
* Minimum iOS deployment target is upgraded to 11.0 in this release, which means armv7 HW is no longer supported.

#### New features

* Embedded (on-device) Speech Recognition now supports both 8 and 16-kHz sampling rate input audio (16-bit per sample, mono PCM).
* Speech Synthesis now reports connection, network, and service latencies in the result to help end-to-end latency optimization.
* New tie breaking rules for [Intent Recognition with simple pattern matching](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/766e4b444667054247ad440e9c5a418efa71c050/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-simple-language-pattern-matching.md). The more character bytes that are matched, will win over pattern matches with lower character byte count. Example: Pattern "Select {something} in the top right" will win over "Select {something}"

#### Bug fixes

* Speech Synthesis: fix a bug where the emoji isn't correct in word boundary events.
* [Intent Recognition with Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/766e4b444667054247ad440e9c5a418efa71c050/articles/ai-services/speech-service/get-started-intent-recognition-clu.md):
  * Intents from the CLU Orchestrator Workflow now appear correctly.
  * The JSON result is now available via the property ID `LanguageUnderstandingServiceResponse_JsonResult`.
* Speech recognition with keyword activation: Fix for missing ~150 ms audio after a keyword recognition.
* Fix for Speech SDK NuGet iOS MAUI Release build, reported by customer ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1835))

#### Samples

* Fix for Swift iOS sample, reported by customer ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1759))


### Speech SDK 1.25.0: January 2023 release

#### Breaking changes

- Language Identification (preview) APIs have been simplified. If you update to Speech SDK 1.25 and see a build break, please visit the [Language Identification](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/766e4b444667054247ad440e9c5a418efa71c050/articles/ai-services/speech-service/includes/release-notes/~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-identification.md) page to learn about the new property `SpeechServiceConnection_LanguageIdMode`. This single property replaces the two previous ones `SpeechServiceConnection_SingleLanguageIdPriority` and `SpeechServiceConnection_ContinuousLanguageIdPriority`. Prioritizing between low latency and high accuracy is no longer necessary following recent model improvements. Now, you only need to select whether to run at-start or continuous Language Identification when doing continuous speech recognition or translation.

#### New features

- **C#/C++/Java**: Embedded Speech SDK is now released under gated public preview. See [Embedded Speech (preview)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/766e4b444667054247ad440e9c5a418efa71c050/articles/ai-services/speech-service/includes/release-notes/~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/embedded-speech.md) documentation.

- **All programming languages**: PronunciationAssessmentConfig now has properties to set the desired phoneme alphabet (IPA or SAPI) and N-Best Phoneme Count (avoiding the need to author a configuration JSON as per [GitHub issue 1284](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1284)). Also, syllable level output is now supported.
- **Android, iOS, and macOS (all programming languages)**: GStreamer is no longer needed to support limited-bandwidth networks. SpeechSynthesizer now uses the operating system's audio decoding capabilities to decode compressed audio streamed from the text to speech service.
- **All programming languages**: SpeechSynthesizer now supports three new raw output Opus formats (without container), which are widely used in live streaming scenarios.
- **JavaScript**: Added getVoicesAsync() API to SpeechSynthesizer to retrieve the list of supported synthesis voices ([GitHub issue 1350](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1350))
- **JavaScript**: Added getWaveFormat() API to AudioStreamFormat to support non-PCM wave formats ([GitHub issue 452](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/452))
- **JavaScript**: Added volume getter/setter and mute()/unmute() APIs to SpeakerAudioDestination ([GitHub issue 463](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/463))

#### Bug fixes
- **C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, and Swift**: Fix to remove a 10-second delay while stopping a speech recognizer that uses a PushAudioInputStream. This is for the case where no new audio is pushed in after StopContinuousRecognition is called (GitHub issues [1318](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1388), [331](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/331))
- **Unity on Android and UWP**: Unity meta files were fixed for UWP, Android Arm64, and Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) Arm64 ([GitHub issue 1360](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1360))
- **iOS**: Compiling your Speech SDK application on any iOS Device when using CocoaPods is now fixed ([GitHub issue 1320](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1320))
- **iOS**: When SpeechSynthesizer is configured to output audio directly to a speaker, playback stopped at the beginning in rare conditions. This was fixed.
- **JavaScript**: Use script processor fallback for microphone input if no audio worklet is found ([GitHub issue 455](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/455))
- **JavaScript**: Add protocol to agent to mitigate bug found with Sentry integration ([GitHub issue 465](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/465))

### Speech SDK 1.17.0: 2021-May release

> **Note:**
> Get started with the Speech SDK [here](quickstarts/setup-platform.md).

#### Highlights summary

- Smaller footprint - we continue to decrease the memory and disk footprint of the Speech SDK and its components.
- A new stand-alone Language Identification API allows you to recognize what language is being spoken.
- Develop speech enabled mixed reality and gaming applications using Unity on macOS.
- You can now use Text to speech in addition to speech recognition from the Go programming language.
- Several Bug fixes to address issues YOU, our valued customers, have flagged on GitHub! THANK YOU! Keep the feedback coming!

#### New features

- **C++/C#**: New stand-alone At-Start and Continuous Language Detection via the `SourceLanguageRecognizer` API. If you only want to detect the language(s) spoken in audio content, this is the API to do that. See details for [C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/sourcelanguagerecognizer) and [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.sourcelanguagerecognizer).
- **C++/C#**: Speech Recognition and Translation Recognition now support both at-start and continuous Language Identification so you can programmatically determine which language(s) are being spoken before they're transcribed or translated. See documentation [here for Speech Recognition](language-identification.md) and [here for Speech Translation](get-started-speech-translation.md).
- **C#**:  Added support Unity support to macOS (x64). This unlocks speech recognition and speech synthesis use cases in mixed reality and gaming!
- **Go**: We added support for speech synthesis text to speech to the Go programming language to make speech synthesis available in even more use cases. See our [quickstart](get-started-text-to-speech.md?tabs=windowsinstall\&pivots=programming-language-go) or our [reference documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-go).
- **C++/C#/Java/Python/Objective-C/Go**: The speech synthesizer now supports the `connection` object. This helps you manage and monitor the connection to the Speech service, and is especially helpful to pre-connect to reduce latency. See documentation [here](how-to-lower-speech-synthesis-latency.md).
- **C++/C#/Java/Python/Objective-C/Go**: We now expose the latency and underrun time in `SpeechSynthesisResult` to help you monitor and diagnose speech synthesis latency issues. See details for [C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/speechsynthesisresult), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisresult), [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisresult), [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisresult), [Objective-C](https://learn.microsoft.com/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxspeechsynthesisresult) and [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-go#readme-reference).
- **C++/C#/Java/Python/Objective-C**: Text to speech [now uses neural voices](text-to-speech.md#key-features) by default when you don't specify a voice to be used. This gives you higher fidelity output by default, but also [increases the default price](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/speech-services/#pricing). 
- **C++/C#/Java/Python/Objective-C/Go**: We added a Gender property to the synthesis voice info to make it easier to select voices based on gender. This addresses [GitHub issue #1055](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/1055).
- **C++, C#, Java, JavaScript**: We now support `retrieveEnrollmentResultAsync`, `getAuthorizationPhrasesAsync`, and `getAllProfilesAsync()` in Speaker Recognition to ease user management of all voice profiles for a given account. See documentation for [C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech), [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/), [JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/). This addresses [GitHub issue #338](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/338).
- **JavaScript**: We added retry for connection failures that will make your JavaScript-based speech applications more robust.

#### Improvements

- Linux and Android Speech SDK binaries have been updated to use the latest version of OpenSSL (1.1.1k)
- Code Size improvements:
    - Language Understanding is now split into a separate "lu" library.
    - Windows x64 core binary size decreased by 14.4%.
    - Android Arm64 core binary size decreased by 13.7%.
    - other components also decreased in size.

#### Bug fixes

- **All**: Fixed [GitHub issue #842](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/842) for ServiceTimeout. You can now transcribe long audio files using the Speech SDK without the connection to the service terminating with this error. However, we still recommend you use [batch transcription](batch-transcription.md) for long files.
- **C#**: Fixed [GitHub issue #947](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/947) where no speech input could leave your app in a bad state.
- **Java**: Fixed [GitHub Issue #997](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/997) where the Speech SDK for Java 1.16 crashes when using DialogServiceConnector without a network connection or an invalid subscription key.

- **Java**: Added a fix to delete temporary files on Windows when using Speech SDK for Java.
- **Java**: Fixed [GitHub issue #994](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/994) where calling `DialogServiceConnector.stopListeningAsync` could result in an error.
- **Java**: Fixed a customer issue in the [virtual assistant quickstart](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/java/jre/virtual-assistant).
- **JavaScript**: Fixed [GitHub issue #366](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/366) where `ConversationTranslator` threw an error 'this.cancelSpeech isn't a function'.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed [GitHub issue #298](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/298) where 'Get result as an in-memory stream' sample played sound out loud.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed [GitHub issue #350](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/350) where calling `AudioConfig` could result in a 'ReferenceError: MediaStream isn't defined'.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed an UnhandledPromiseRejection warning in Node.js for long-running sessions.

#### Samples

- Updated Unity samples documentation for macOS [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk).
- A React Native sample for the Azure Speech recognition service is now available [here](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-sdk-react-native-example).


### Speech SDK 1.16.0: 2021-March release

> **Note:**
> The Speech SDK on Windows depends on the shared Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019.

#### New features

- **C++/C#/Java/Python**: Moved to the latest version of GStreamer (1.18.3) to add support for transcribing any media format on Windows, Linux, and Android. See documentation [here](how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md).
- **C++/C#/Java/Objective-C/Python**: Added support for decoding compressed TTS/synthesized audio to the SDK. If you set output audio format to PCM and GStreamer is available on your system, the SDK will automatically request compressed audio from the service to save bandwidth and decode the audio on the client. You can set `SpeechServiceConnection_SynthEnableCompressedAudioTransmission` to `false` to disable this feature. Details for [C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-namespace#propertyid), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.propertyid), [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.propertyid), [Objective-C](https://learn.microsoft.com/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxpropertyid), [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.propertyid).
- **JavaScript**: Node.js users can now use the [`AudioConfig.fromWavFileInput` API](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/audioconfig#fromWavFileInput_File_). This addresses [GitHub issue #252](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/252).
- **C++/C#/Java/Objective-C/Python**: Added `GetVoicesAsync()` method for TTS to return all available synthesis voices. Details for [C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/speechsynthesizer#getvoicesasync), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesizer#methods), [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesizer#methods), [Objective-C](https://learn.microsoft.com/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxspeechsynthesizer#getvoiceasync), and [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesizer#methods).
- **C++/C#/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Python**: Added `VisemeReceived` event for TTS/speech synthesis to return synchronous viseme animation. See documentation [here](how-to-speech-synthesis-viseme.md).
- **C++/C#/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Python**: Added `BookmarkReached` event for TTS. You can set bookmarks in the input SSML and get the audio offsets for each bookmark. See documentation [here](speech-synthesis-markup-structure.md#bookmark-element).
- **Java**: Added support for Speaker Recognition APIs. Details [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/).
- **C++/C#/Java/JavaScript/Objective-C/Python**: Added two new output audio formats with WebM container for TTS (Webm16Khz16BitMonoOpus and Webm24Khz16BitMonoOpus). These are better formats for streaming audio with the Opus codec. Details for [C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-namespace#speechsynthesisoutputformat), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisoutputformat), [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisoutputformat), [JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechsynthesisoutputformat), [Objective-C](https://learn.microsoft.com/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxspeechsynthesisoutputformat), [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechsynthesisoutputformat).
- **C++/C#/Java**: Added support for retrieving voice profile for Speaker Recognition scenario. Details for [C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech), and [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/).
- **C++/C#/Java/Objective-C/Python**: Added support for separate shared library for audio microphone and speaker control. This allows the developer to use the SDK in environments that don't have required audio library dependencies.
- **Objective-C/Swift**: Added support for module framework with umbrella header. This allows the developer to import Speech SDK as a module in iOS/Mac Objective-C/Swift apps. This addresses [GitHub issue #452](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/452).
- **Python**: Added support for [Python 3.9](quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-python) and dropped support for Python 3.5 per Python's [end-of-life for 3.5](https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches).

**Known issues**

- **C++/C#/Java**: `DialogServiceConnector` can't use a `CustomCommandsConfig` to access a Custom Commands application and will instead encounter a connection error. This can be worked around by manually adding your application ID to the request with `config.SetServiceProperty("X-CommandsAppId", "your-application-id", ServicePropertyChannel.UriQueryParameter)`. The expected behavior of `CustomCommandsConfig` will be restored in the next release.

#### Improvements

- As part of our multi-release effort to reduce the Speech SDK's memory usage and disk footprint, Android binaries are now 3% to 5% smaller.
- Improved accuracy, readability, and see-also sections of our C# reference documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech).

#### Bug fixes

- **JavaScript**: Large WAV file headers are now parsed correctly (increases header slice to 512 bytes). This addresses [GitHub issue #962](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/962).
- **JavaScript**: Corrected microphone timing issue if mic stream ends before stop recognition, addressing an issue with Speech Recognition not working in Firefox.
- **JavaScript**: We now correctly handle initialization promise when the browser forces mic off before turnOn completes.
- **JavaScript**: We replaced URL dependency with url-parse. This addresses [GitHub issue #264](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/264).
- **Android**: Fixed callbacks not working when `minifyEnabled` is set to true.
- **C++/C#/Java/Objective-C/Python**: `TCP_NODELAY` will be correctly set to underlying socket IO for TTS to reduce latency.
- **C++/C#/Java/Python/Objective-C/Go**: Fixed an occasional crash when the recognizer was destroyed just after starting a recognition.
- **C++/C#/Java**: Fixed an occasional crash in the destruction of speaker recognizer.

#### Samples

- **JavaScript**: [Browser samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/js/browser) no longer require separate JavaScript library file download.


### Speech SDK 1.15.0: 2021-January release

> **Note:**
> The Speech SDK on Windows depends on the shared Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019.

#### Highlights summary
- Smaller memory and disk footprint making the SDK more efficient.
- Higher fidelity output formats available for custom-neural voice preview.
- Intent Recognizer can now get return more than the top intent, giving you the ability to make a separate assessment about your customer's intent.
- Voice assistants and bots are now easier to set up, and you can make it stop listening immediately, and exercise greater control over how it responds to errors.
- Improved on device performance through making compression optional.
- Use the Speech SDK on Windows ARM/Arm64.
- Improved low-level debugging.
- Pronunciation Assessment feature is now more widely available.
- Several Bug fixes to address issues YOU, our valued customers, have flagged on GitHub! THANK YOU! Keep the feedback coming!

#### Improvements
- The Speech SDK is now more efficient and lightweight. We've started a multi-release effort to reduce the Speech SDK's memory usage and disk footprint. As a first step we made significant file size reductions in shared libraries on most platforms. Compared to the 1.14 release:
  - 64-bit UWP-compatible Windows libraries are about 30% smaller.
  - 32-bit Windows libraries aren't yet seeing a size improvement.
  - Linux libraries are 20-25% smaller.
  - Android libraries are 3-5% smaller.

#### New features
- **All**: New 48 KHz output formats available for the preview of custom-neural voice through the TTS speech synthesis API: Audio48Khz192KBitRateMonoMp3, audio-48khz-192kbitrate-mono-mp3, Audio48Khz96KBitRateMonoMp3, audio-48khz-96kbitrate-mono-mp3, Raw48Khz16BitMonoPcm, raw-48khz-16bit-mono-pcm, Riff48Khz16BitMonoPcm, riff-48khz-16bit-mono-pcm.
- **All**: Custom voice is also easier to use. Added support for setting custom voice via `EndpointId` ([C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/speechconfig#setendpointid), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.endpointid#Microsoft_CognitiveServices_Speech_SpeechConfig_EndpointId), [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig.setendpointid#com_microsoft_cognitiveservices_speech_SpeechConfig_setEndpointId_String_), [JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/speechconfig#endpointId), [Objective-C](https://learn.microsoft.com/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxspeechconfiguration#endpointid), [Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-speech/azure.cognitiveservices.speech.speechconfig#endpoint-id)). Before this change, custom voice users needed to set the endpoint URL via the `FromEndpoint` method. Now customers can use the `FromSubscription` method just like standard voices, and then provide the deployment ID by setting `EndpointId`. This simplifies setting up custom voices.
- **C++/C#/Java/Objective-C/Python**: Get more than the top intent from`IntentRecognizer`. It now supports configuring the JSON result containing all intents and not only the top scoring intent via `LanguageUnderstandingModel FromEndpoint` method by using `verbose=true` uri parameter. This addresses [GitHub issue #880](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/880). See updated documentation [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-ai-docs/blob/766e4b444667054247ad440e9c5a418efa71c050/articles/ai-services/speech-service/get-started-intent-recognition.md#add-a-languageunderstandingmodel-and-intents).
- **C++/C#/Java**: Make your voice assistant or bot stop listening immediately. `DialogServiceConnector` ([C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/dialog-dialogserviceconnector), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.dialogserviceconnector), [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.dialogserviceconnector)) now has a `StopListeningAsync()` method to accompany `ListenOnceAsync()`. This will immediately stop audio capture and gracefully wait for a result, making it perfect for use with "stop now" button-press scenarios.
- **C++/C#/Java/JavaScript**: Make your voice assistant or bot react better to underlying system errors. `DialogServiceConnector` ([C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/dialog-dialogserviceconnector), [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.dialogserviceconnector), [Java](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.dialogserviceconnector), [JavaScript](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/dialogserviceconnector)) now has a new `TurnStatusReceived` event handler. These optional events correspond to every [`ITurnContext`](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.bot.builder.iturncontext) resolution on the Bot and will report turn execution failures when they happen, for example, as a result of an unhandled exception, timeout, or network drop between Direct Line Speech and the bot. `TurnStatusReceived` makes it easier to respond to failure conditions. For example, if a bot takes too long on a backend database query (for example, looking up a product), `TurnStatusReceived` allows the client to know to reprompt with "sorry, I didn't quite get that, could you please try again" or something similar.
- **C++/C#**: Use the Speech SDK on more platforms. The [Speech SDK NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech) now supports Windows ARM/Arm64 desktop native binaries (UWP was already supported) to make the Speech SDK more useful on more machine types.
- **Java**: [`DialogServiceConnector`](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.dialogserviceconnector) now has a `setSpeechActivityTemplate()` method that was unintentionally excluded from the language previously. This is equivalent to setting the `Conversation_Speech_Activity_Template` property and will request that all future Bot Framework activities originated by the Direct Line Speech service merge the provided content into their JSON payloads.
- **Java**: Improved low-level debugging. The [`Connection`](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.microsoft.cognitiveservices.speech.connection) class now has a `MessageReceived` event, similar to other programming languages (C++, C#). This event provides low-level access to incoming data from the service and can be useful for diagnostics and debugging.
- **JavaScript**: Easier setup for Voice Assistants and bots through [`BotFrameworkConfig`](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/botframeworkconfig), which now has `fromHost()` and `fromEndpoint()` factory methods that simplify the use of custom service locations versus manually setting properties. We also standardized optional specification of `botId` to use a non-default bot across the configuration factories.
- **JavaScript**: Improved on device performance through added string control property for websocket compression. For performance reasons, we disabled websocket compression by default. This can be reenabled for low-bandwidth scenarios. More details [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/propertyid). This addresses [GitHub issue #242](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/242).
- **JavaScript**: Added support for lPronunciation Assessment to enable evaluation of speech pronunciation. See the quickstart [here](how-to-pronunciation-assessment.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript).

#### Bug fixes
- **All** (except JavaScript): Fixed a regression in version 1.14, in which too much memory was allocated by the recognizer.
- **C++**: Fixed a garbage collection issue with `DialogServiceConnector`, addressing [GitHub issue #794](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/794).
- **C#**: Fixed an issue with thread shutdown that caused objects to block for about a second when disposed.
- **C++/C#/Java**: Fixed an exception preventing an application from setting speech authorization token or activity template more than once on a `DialogServiceConnector`.
- **C++/C#/Java**: Fixed a recognizer crash due to a race condition in teardown.
- **JavaScript**: [`DialogServiceConnector`](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk/dialogserviceconnector) didn't previously honor the optional `botId` parameter specified in `BotFrameworkConfig`'s factories. This made it necessary to set the `botId` query string parameter manually to use a non-default bot. The bug has been corrected and `botId` values provided to `BotFrameworkConfig`'s factories will be honored and used, including the new `fromHost()` and `fromEndpoint()` additions. This also applies to the `applicationId` parameter for `CustomCommandsConfig`.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed [GitHub issue #881](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/881), allowing recognizer object reusage.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed an issue where the SKD was sending `speech.config` multiple times in one TTS session, wasting bandwidth.
- **JavaScript**: Simplified error handling on microphone authorization, allowing more descriptive message to bubble up when user hasn't allowed microphone input on their browser.
- **JavaScript**: Fixed [GitHub issue #249](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/issues/249) where type errors in `ConversationTranslator` and `ConversationTranscriber` caused a compilation error for TypeScript users.
- **Objective-C**: Fixed an issue where GStreamer build failed for iOS on Xcode 11.4, addressing [GitHub issue #911](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/911).
- **Python**: Fixed [GitHub issue #870](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/870), removing "DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favor of importlib".

#### Samples
- [From-file sample for JavaScript browser](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/blob/master/quickstart/javascript/browser/from-file/index.html) now uses files for speech recognition. This addresses [GitHub issue #884](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/issues/884).

### Speech SDK 1.10.0: 2020-February release

#### New features

 - Added Python packages to support the new 3.8 release of Python.
 - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)/CentOS 8 x64 support (C++, C#, Java, Python).
   > **Note:**
   > Customers must configure OpenSSL according to [these instructions](how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md).
 - Linux ARM32 support for Debian and Ubuntu.
 - DialogServiceConnector now supports an optional "bot ID" parameter on BotFrameworkConfig. This parameter allows the use of multiple Direct Line Speech bots with a single Speech resource. Without the parameter specified, the default bot (as determined by the Direct Line Speech channel configuration page) will be used.
 - DialogServiceConnector now has a SpeechActivityTemplate property. The contents of this JSON string will be used by Direct Line Speech to prepopulate a wide variety of supported fields in all activities that reach a Direct Line Speech bot, including activities automatically generated in response to events like speech recognition.
 - TTS now uses subscription key for authentication, reducing the first byte latency of the first synthesis result after creating a synthesizer.
 - Updated speech recognition models for 19 locales for an average word error rate reduction of 18.6% (es-ES, es-MX, fr-CA, fr-FR, it-IT, ja-JP, ko-KR, pt-BR, zh-CN, zh-HK, nb-NO, fi-FL, ru-RU, pl-PL, ca-ES, zh-TW, th-TH, pt-PT, tr-TR). The new models bring significant improvements across multiple domains including Dictation, Call-Center Transcription, and Video Indexing scenarios.

#### Bug fixes

 - Fixed bug where Conversation Transcriber didn't await properly in JAVA APIs.
 - Add missing (Get|Set)Property methods to AudioConfig.
 - Fix a TTS bug where the audioDataStream couldn't be stopped when connection fails.
 - Using an endpoint without a region would cause USP failures for conversation translator.
 - ID generation in Universal Windows Applications now uses an appropriately unique GUID algorithm; it previously and unintentionally defaulted to a stubbed implementation that often produced collisions over large sets of interactions.

 #### Samples

 - Unity sample for using Speech SDK with [Unity microphone and push mode streaming](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/samples/csharp)

**Other changes**

 - [OpenSSL configuration documentation updated for Linux](how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md)

### Speech SDK 1.9.0: 2020-January release

#### New features

- Multi-device conversation: connect multiple devices to the same speech or text-based conversation, and optionally translate messages sent between them.
- Keyword recognition support added for Android `.aar` package and added support for x86 and x64 flavors.
- Objective-C: `SendMessage` and `SetMessageProperty` methods added to `Connection` object. See documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/objectivec/cognitive-services/speech/spxconnection).
- TTS C++ API now supports `std::wstring` as synthesis text input, removing the need to convert a wstring to string before passing it to the SDK. See details [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/cpp/cognitive-services/speech/speechsynthesizer#speaktextasync).
- C#: [Language ID](language-identification.md?pivots=programming-language-csharp) and [source language config](how-to-recognize-speech.md) are now available.
- JavaScript: Added a feature to `Connection` object to pass through custom messages from the Speech service as callback `receivedServiceMessage`.
- JavaScript: Added support for `FromHost API` to ease use with on-premises containers and sovereign clouds. See documentation [here](speech-container-howto.md).
- JavaScript: We now honor `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` thanks to a contribution from [orgads](https://github.com/orgads). See details [here](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js/pull/75).

**Breaking changes**

- `OpenSSL` has been updated to version 1.1.1b and is statically linked to the Speech SDK core library for Linux. This may cause a break if your inbox `OpenSSL` hasn't been installed to the `/usr/lib/ssl` directory in the system. Check [our documentation](how-to-configure-openssl-linux.md) under Speech SDK docs to work around the issue.
- We've changed the data type returned for C# `WordLevelTimingResult.Offset` from `int` to `long` to allow for access to `WordLevelTimingResults` when speech data is longer than 2 minutes.
- `PushAudioInputStream` and `PullAudioInputStream` now send wav header information to the Speech service based on `AudioStreamFormat`, optionally specified when they were created. Customers must now use the [supported audio input format](how-to-use-audio-input-streams.md). Any other formats will get suboptimal recognition results or may cause other issues.

#### Bug fixes

- See the `OpenSSL` update under Breaking changes above. We fixed both an intermittent crash and a performance issue (lock contention under high load) in Linux and Java.
- Java: Made improvements to object closure in high concurrency scenarios.
- Restructured our NuGet package. We removed the three copies of `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.core.dll` and `Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.extension.kws.dll` under lib folders, making the NuGet package smaller and faster to download, and we added headers needed to compile some C++ native apps.

- Proxy Support: In the `SpeechConfig` object, you can now call a function to set the proxy information (hostname, port, username, and password). This feature isn't yet available on iOS.
- Improved error code and messages. If a recognition returned an error, this did already set `Reason` (in canceled event) or `CancellationDetails` (in recognition result) to `Error`. The canceled event now contains two additional members, `ErrorCode` and `ErrorDetails`. If the server returned additional error information with the reported error, it will now be available in the new members.

#### Improvements

- Added additional verification in the recognizer configuration, and added additional error message.
- Improved handling of long-time silence in middle of an audio file.

- Support long-running recognition with automatic reconnection.

**Functional changes**

- `StartContinuousRecognitionAsync()` supports long-running recognition.
- The recognition result contains more fields. They're offset from the audio beginning and duration (both in ticks) of the recognized text and additional values that represent recognition status, for example, `InitialSilenceTimeout` and `InitialBabbleTimeout`.
- Support AuthorizationToken for creating factory instances.

**Breaking changes**

- Recognition events: `NoMatch` event type was merged into the `Error` event.
- SpeechOutputFormat in C# was renamed to `OutputFormat` to stay aligned with C++.
- The return type of some methods of the `AudioInputStream` interface changed slightly:
  - In Java, the `read` method now returns `long` instead of `int`.
  - In C#, the `Read` method now returns `uint` instead of `int`.
  - In C++, the `Read` and `GetFormat` methods now return `size_t` instead of `int`.
- C++: Instances of audio input streams now can be passed only as a `shared_ptr`.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed incorrect return values in the result when `RecognizeAsync()` times out.
- The dependency on media foundation libraries on Windows was removed. The SDK now uses Core Audio APIs.
- Documentation fix: Added a [regions](regions.md) page to describe the supported regions.

#### Known Issue

- The Speech SDK for Android doesn't report speech synthesis results for translation. This issue will be fixed in the next release.

  A recognizer now can consume a stream as the audio source. For more information, see the related [how-to guide](how-to-use-audio-input-streams.md).

- Detailed output format

  When you create a `SpeechRecognizer`, you can request `Detailed` or `Simple` output format. The `DetailedSpeechRecognitionResult` contains a confidence score, recognized text, raw lexical form, normalized form, and normalized form with masked profanity.

#### Breaking change

- Changed to `SpeechRecognitionResult.Text` from `SpeechRecognitionResult.RecognizedText` in C#.

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed a possible callback issue in the USP layer during shutdown.
- If a recognizer consumed an audio input file, it was holding on to the file handle longer than necessary.
- Removed several deadlocks between the message pump and the recognizer.
- Fire a `NoMatch` result when the response from service is timed out.
- The media foundation libraries on Windows are delay loaded. This library is required for microphone input only.
- The upload speed for audio data is limited to about twice the original audio speed.
- On Windows, C# .NET assemblies now are strong named.
- Documentation fix: `Region` is required information to create a recognizer.

More samples have been added and are constantly being updated. For the latest set of samples, see the [Speech SDK samples GitHub repository](https://aka.ms/csspeech/samples).

### November 2023 release

#### Personal voice

Personal voice is available in preview in the following regions: West Europe, East US, and South East Asia. With personal voice (preview), you can get AI generated replication of your voice (or users of your application) in a few seconds. You provide a one-minute speech sample as the audio prompt, and then use it to generate speech in any of the more than 90 languages supported across more than 100 locales.  

For more information, see [personal voice](personal-voice-overview.md).

#### Text to speech avatar

Text to speech avatar is available in preview in the following regions: West US 2, West Europe, and Southeast Asia. 

Text to speech avatar converts text into a digital video of a photorealistic human (either a standard avatar or a [custom text to speech avatar](text-to-speech-avatar/what-is-custom-text-to-speech-avatar.md)) speaking with a natural-sounding voice. The text to speech avatar video can be synthesized asynchronously or in real time. Developers can build applications integrated with text to speech avatar through an API, or use a content creation tool on Speech Studio to create video content without coding.

For more information, see [text to speech avatar](text-to-speech-avatar/what-is-text-to-speech-avatar.md), [transparency notes](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/speech-service/text-to-speech/transparency-note), and [disclosure for voice and avatar talent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/responsible-ai/speech-service/text-to-speech/disclosure-voice-talent).

#### Standard voices

Introducing new `en-US` gender neutral voice for public preview:

| Locale (BCP-47) | Language | Text to speech voices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `en-US` | English (United States) | `en-US-BlueNeural` (Neutral) |

Introducing new multilingual voices for public preview:

| Locale (BCP-47) | Language | Text to speech voices |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `en-US` | English (United States) | `en-US-JennyMultilingualV2Neural` (Female) |
| `en-US` | English (United States) | `en-US-RyanMultilingualNeural` (Male) |

The multilingual voices `en-US-JennyMultilingualV2Neural` and `en-US-RyanMultilingualNeural` auto-detect the language of the input text. However, you can still use the `<lang>` element to adjust the speaking language for these voices.

These new multilingual voices can speak in 41 languages and accents: `Arabic (Egypt)`, `Arabic (Saudi Arabia)`, `Catalan`, `Czech (Czechia)`, `Danish (Denmark)`, `German (Austria)`, `German (Switzerland)`, `German (Germany)`, `English (Australia)`, `English (Canada)`, `English (United Kingdom)`, `English (Hong Kong SAR)`, `English (Ireland)`, `English (India)`, `English (United States)`, `Spanish (Spain)`, `Spanish (Mexico)`, `Finnish (Finland)`, `French (Belgium)`, `French (Canada)`, `French (Switzerland)`, `French (France)`, `Hindi (India)`, `Hungarian (Hungary)`, `Indonesian (Indonesia)`, `Italian (Italy)`, `Japanese (Japan)`, `Korean (Korea)`, `Norwegian Bokmål (Norway)`, `Dutch (Belgium)`, `Dutch (Netherlands)`, `Polish (Poland)`, `Portuguese (Brazil)`, `Portuguese (Portugal)`, `Russian (Russia)`, `Swedish (Sweden)`, `Thai (Thailand)`, `Turkish (Türkiye)`, `Chinese (Mandarin, Simplified)`, `Chinese (Cantonese, Traditional)`, `Chinese (Taiwanese Mandarin, Traditional)`.

These multilingual voices don't fully support certain SSML elements, such as break, emphasis, silence, and sub.

> **Important:**
> The `en-US-JennyMultilingualV2Neural` voice is provided temporarily in public preview solely for evaluation purposes. It will be removed in the future. 
> 
> In order to speak in a language other than English, the current implementation of the `en-US-JennyMultilingualNeural` voice requires that you set the `<lang xml:lang>` element. We anticipate that during Q4 calendar year 2023, the `en-US-JennyMultilingualNeural` voice will be updated to speak in the language of the input text without the `<lang xml:lang>` element. This will be in parity with the `en-US-JennyMultilingualV2Neural` voice.

Introducing new features in public preview for below voices:
- Added Latin input for Serbian (Serbia) `sr-RS` voices: `sr-latn-RS-SophieNeural` and `sr-latn-RS-NicholasNeural`.
- Added English pronunciation support for Albanian (Albania) `sq-AL` voices: `sq-AL-AnilaNeural` and `sq-AL-IlirNeural`.
