# QuickStart: Analyze image content

Get started with the Content Studio, REST API, or client SDKs to do basic image moderation. The Azure AI Content Safety service provides you with AI algorithms for flagging objectionable content. Follow these steps to try it out.

For more information on image moderation, see the [Harm categories concept page](concepts/harm-categories.md). For API input limits, see the [Input requirements](overview.md#input-requirements) section of the Overview. 

> **Caution:**
> 
> The sample data and code may contain offensive content. User discretion is advised.

**Applies to: programming-language-foundry-portal**



## Prerequisites

- An Azure account. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn).
- An [Azure AI resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ProjectOxford/CognitiveServicesHub/~/AIServices). 

## Setup

Follow these steps to use the Content Safety **try it out** page: 

1. Go to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) and navigate to your project/hub. Then select the **Guardrails + controls** tab on the left nav and select the **Try it out** tab.
1. On the **Try it out** page, you can experiment with various Guardrails & controls features such as text and image content, using adjustable thresholds to filter for inappropriate or harmful content.

Screenshot of the try it out page for Guardrails & controls.

## Analyze images

The **Moderate image** page provides capability for you to quickly try out image moderation.

1. Select the **Moderate image content** panel. 
1. Select a sample image from the panels on the page, or upload your own image. 
1. Select **Run test**. 
    The service returns all the categories that were detected, with the severity level for each: 0-Safe, 2-Low, 4-Medium, 6-High. It also returns a binary **Accepted**/**Rejected** result, based on the filters you configure. Use the matrix in the **Configure filters** tab on the right to set your allowed/prohibited severity levels for each category. Then you can run the text again to see how the filter works.

## View and export code 

You can use the **View Code** feature in either the **Analyze text content** or **Analyze image content** pages to view and copy the sample code, which includes configuration for severity filtering, blocklists, and moderation functions. You can then deploy the code on your end.

Screenshot of the View code button.




**Applies to: programming-language-rest**



## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) 
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://aka.ms/acs-create"  title="Create a Content Safety resource"  target="_blank">create a Content Safety resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. Enter a unique name for your resource, select your subscription, and select a resource group, supported region (see [Region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview#region-availability)), and supported pricing tier. Then select **Create**.
  * The resource takes a few minutes to deploy. After it finishes, select **go to resource**. In the left pane, under **Resource Management**, select **Subscription Key and Endpoint**. The endpoint and either of the keys are used to call APIs.
* [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) installed


## Analyze image content

The following section walks through a sample image moderation request with cURL. 

### Prepare a sample image

Choose a sample image to analyze, and download it to your device. 

See [Input requirements](overview.md#input-requirements) for the image limitations. If your format is animated, the service will extract the first frame to do the analysis.

You can input your image by one of two methods: **local filestream** or **blob storage URL**.
- **Local filestream** (recommended): Encode your image to base64. You can use a website like [codebeautify](https://codebeautify.org/image-to-base64-converter) to do the encoding. Then save the encoded string to a temporary location. 
- **Blob storage URL**: Upload your image to an Azure Blob Storage account. Follow the [blob storage quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal) to learn how to do this. Then open Azure Storage Explorer and get the URL to your image. Save it to a temporary location. 

   

Next, you need to give your Content Safety resource access to read from the Azure Storage resource. Enable system-assigned Managed identity for the Azure AI Content Safety instance and assign the role of **Storage Blob Data Contributor/Owner** to the identity:
> **Important:**
> **Only Storage Blob Data Contributor or Storage Blob Data Owner are valid roles to proceed.**

1. Enable managed identity for the Azure AI Content Safety instance. 

    Screenshot of Azure portal enabling managed identity.

1. Assign the role of **Storage Blob Data Contributor/Owner** to the Managed identity. Any roles highlighted below should work.

    Screenshot of the Add role assignment screen in Azure portal.

    Screenshot of assigned roles in the Azure portal.

    Screenshot of the managed identity role.


### Analyze image content

Paste the command below into a text editor, and make the following changes.

1. Replace `<endpoint>` with your resource endpoint URL.
1. Replace `<your_subscription_key>` with your key.
1. Populate the `"image"` field in the body with either a `"content"` field or a `"blobUrl"` field. For example: `{"image": {"content": "<base_64_string>"}` or `{"image": {"blobUrl": "<your_storage_url>"}`.

```shell
curl --location --request POST '<endpoint>/contentsafety/image:analyze?api-version=2024-09-01' \
--header 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your_subscription_key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "image": {
    "content": "<base_64_string>"
  },
  "categories": ["Hate", "SelfHarm", "Sexual", "Violence"],
  "outputType": "FourSeverityLevels"
}'
```

> **Note:**
> If you're using a blob storage URL, the request body should look like this:
>
> ```
> {
>   "image": {
>     "blobUrl": "<your_storage_url>"
>   }
> }
> ```

The below fields must be included in the URL:

| Name | Required? | Description | Type |
| :--- | --- | :--- | --- |
| **API Version** | Required | This is the API version to be checked. Current version is: `api-version=2024-09-01`. Example: `<endpoint>/contentsafety/image:analyze?api-version=2024-09-01` | String |

The parameters in the request body are defined in this table:

| Name | Required? | Description | Type |
| :--- | --- | :--- | --- |
| **content** | Required | The content or blob URL of the image. I can be either base64-encoded bytes or a blob URL. If both are given, the request is refused. The maximum allowed size of the image is 7,200 x 7,200 pixels, and the maximum file size is 4 MB. The minimum size of the image is 50 pixels x 50 pixels. | String |
| **categories** | Optional | This is assumed to be an array of category names. See the [Harm categories guide](concepts/harm-categories.md) for a list of available category names. If no categories are specified, all four categories are used. We use multiple categories to get scores in a single request. | String |
| **outputType** | Optional | Image moderation API only supports `"FourSeverityLevels"`. Output severities in four levels. The value can be `0,2,4,6` | String |

Open a command prompt window and run the cURL command.


### Output

You should see the image moderation results displayed as JSON data in the console. For example:

```json
{
  "categoriesAnalysis": [
    {
      "category": "Hate",
      "severity": 2
    },
    {
      "category": "SelfHarm",
      "severity": 0
    },
    {
      "category": "Sexual",
      "severity": 0
    },
    {
      "category": "Violence",
      "severity": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

The JSON fields in the output are defined here:

| Name | Description | Type |
| :--- | :--- | --- |
| **categoriesAnalysis** | Each output class that the API predicts. Classification can be multi-labeled. For example, when an image is uploaded to the image moderation model, it could be classified as both sexual content and violence. [Harm categories](concepts/harm-categories.md) | String |
| **Severity** | The severity level of the flag in each harm category. [Harm categories](concepts/harm-categories.md) | Integer |

* [.NET Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/) installed.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://aka.ms/acs-create"  title="Create a Content Safety resource"  target="_blank">create a Content Safety resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. Enter a unique name for your resource, select your subscription, and select a resource group, supported region (see [Region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview#region-availability)), and supported pricing tier. Then select **Create**.
  * The resource takes a few minutes to deploy. After it finishes, Select **go to resource**. In the left pane, under **Resource Management**, select **Subscription Key and Endpoint**. The endpoint and either of the keys are used to call APIs.

## Set up application

Create a new C# application.

#### [Visual Studio IDE](#tab/visual-studio)

Open Visual Studio, and under **Get started** select **Create a new project**. Set the template filters to _C#/All Platforms/Console_. Select **Console App** (command-line application that can run on .NET on Windows, Linux and macOS) and choose **Next**. Update the project name to _ContentSafetyQuickstart_ and choose **Next**. Select **.NET 6.0** or above, and choose **Create** to create the project.

### Install the client SDK 

Once you've created a new project, install the client SDK by right-clicking on the project solution in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Manage NuGet Packages**. In the package manager that opens select **Browse** and search for `Azure.AI.ContentSafety`. Select **Install**.

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `content-safety-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: *Program.cs*.

```dotnet
dotnet new console -n content-safety-quickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. You can build the application with:

```dotnet
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors. 

```console
...
Build succeeded.
  0 Warning(s)
  0 Error(s)
...
```

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY 'YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY'
```

```console
setx CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT 'YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT'
```

After you add the environment variables, you might need to restart any running programs that will read the environment variables, including the console window.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY='YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY'
```

```bash
export CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT='YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT'
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.

## Analyze image content

From the project directory, open the *Program.cs* file that was created previously. Paste in the following code.

```csharp
using System;
using Azure.AI.ContentSafety;

namespace Azure.AI.ContentSafety.Dotnet.Sample
{
  class ContentSafetySampleAnalyzeImage
  {
    public static void AnalyzeImage()
    {
      // retrieve the endpoint and key from the environment variables created earlier
      string endpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT");
      string key = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY");

      ContentSafetyClient client = new ContentSafetyClient(new Uri(endpoint), new AzureKeyCredential(key));

      // Example: analyze image

      string imagePath = @"sample_data\image.png";
      ContentSafetyImageData image = new ContentSafetyImageData(BinaryData.FromBytes(File.ReadAllBytes(imagePath)));

      var request = new AnalyzeImageOptions(image);

      Response<AnalyzeImageResult> response;
      try
      {
          response = client.AnalyzeImage(request);
      }
      catch (RequestFailedException ex)
      {
          Console.WriteLine("Analyze image failed.\nStatus code: {0}, Error code: {1}, Error message: {2}", ex.Status, ex.ErrorCode, ex.Message);
          throw;
      }

      Console.WriteLine("Hate severity: {0}", response.Value.CategoriesAnalysis.FirstOrDefault(a => a.Category == ImageCategory.Hate)?.Severity ?? 0);
      Console.WriteLine("SelfHarm severity: {0}", response.Value.CategoriesAnalysis.FirstOrDefault(a => a.Category == ImageCategory.SelfHarm)?.Severity ?? 0);
      Console.WriteLine("Sexual severity: {0}", response.Value.CategoriesAnalysis.FirstOrDefault(a => a.Category == ImageCategory.Sexual)?.Severity ?? 0);
      Console.WriteLine("Violence severity: {0}", response.Value.CategoriesAnalysis.FirstOrDefault(a => a.Category == ImageCategory.Violence)?.Severity ?? 0);
    }
    static void Main()
    {
      AnalyzeImage();
    }
  }
}
```

Create a _sample_data_ folder in your project directory, and add an _image.png_ file into it.

#### [Visual Studio IDE](#tab/visual-studio)

Build and run the application by selecting **Start Debugging** from the **Debug** menu at the top of the IDE window (or press **F5**).

## Analyze image content

The following section walks through a sample request with the Python SDK.

1. Open a command prompt, navigate to your project folder, and create a new file named *quickstart.py*.
1. Run this command to install the Azure AI Content Safety client library:

    ```console
    python -m pip install azure-ai-contentsafety
    ```

1. Copy the following code into *quickstart.py*:

    ```python
    import os

    from azure.ai.contentsafety import ContentSafetyClient
    from azure.ai.contentsafety.models import AnalyzeImageOptions, ImageData, ImageCategory
    from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential
    from azure.core.exceptions import HttpResponseError
    
    def analyze_image():
        endpoint = os.environ.get('CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT')
        key = os.environ.get('CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY')
        image_path = os.path.join("sample_data", "image.jpg")
    
        # Create an Azure AI Content Safety client
        client = ContentSafetyClient(endpoint, AzureKeyCredential(key))
    
        
        # Build request
        with open(image_path, "rb") as file:
            request = AnalyzeImageOptions(image=ImageData(content=file.read()))

        # Analyze image
        try:
            response = client.analyze_image(request)
        except HttpResponseError as e:
            print("Analyze image failed.")
            if e.error:
                print(f"Error code: {e.error.code}")
                print(f"Error message: {e.error.message}")
                raise
            print(e)
            raise

        hate_result = next(item for item in response.categories_analysis if item.category == ImageCategory.HATE)
        self_harm_result = next(item for item in response.categories_analysis if item.category == ImageCategory.SELF_HARM)
        sexual_result = next(item for item in response.categories_analysis if item.category == ImageCategory.SEXUAL)
        violence_result = next(item for item in response.categories_analysis if item.category == ImageCategory.VIOLENCE)
    
        if hate_result:
            print(f"Hate severity: {hate_result.severity}")
        if self_harm_result:
            print(f"SelfHarm severity: {self_harm_result.severity}")
        if sexual_result:
            print(f"Sexual severity: {sexual_result.severity}")
        if violence_result:
            print(f"Violence severity: {violence_result.severity}")
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        analyze_image()
    ```

1. Replace `"sample_data"` and `"image.jpg"` with the path and filename of the local you want to use.
1. Then run the application with the `python` command on your quickstart file.

    ```console
    python quickstart.py
    ```

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) 
* The current version of the [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk)
* The [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/install/), or another dependency manager.
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://aka.ms/acs-create"  title="Create a Content Safety resource"  target="_blank">create a Content Safety resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. Enter a unique name for your resource, select your subscription, and select a resource group, supported region (see [Region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview#region-availability)), and supported pricing tier. Then select **Create**.
  * The resource takes a few minutes to deploy. After it finishes, Select **go to resource**. In the left pane, under **Resource Management**, select **Subscription Key and Endpoint**. The endpoint and either of the keys are used to call APIs.

## Set up application

Create a new Gradle project.

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 
    
```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `gradle init` command from your working directory. This command will create essential build files for Gradle, including *build.gradle.kts*, which is used at runtime to create and configure your application.

```console
gradle init --type basic
```

When prompted to choose a **DSL**, select **Kotlin**.

From your working directory, run the following command to create a project source folder:

```console
mkdir -p src/main/java
```

Navigate to the new folder and create a file called *ContentSafetyQuickstart.java*.

Also create a `src/resources` folder at the root of your project, and add a sample image to it.

### Install the client SDK 

This quickstart uses the Gradle dependency manager. You can find the client library and information for other dependency managers on the [Maven Central Repository](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.azure/azure-ai-contentsafety).

Locate *build.gradle.kts* and open it with your preferred IDE or text editor. Then copy in the following build configuration. This configuration defines the project as a Java application whose entry point is the class **ContentSafetyQuickstart**. It imports the Azure AI Vision library.

```kotlin
plugins {
    java
    application
}
application { 
    mainClass.set("ContentSafetyQuickstart")
}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
dependencies {
    implementation(group = "com.azure", name = "azure-ai-contentsafety", version = "1.0.0")
}
```


## Create environment variables 

In this example, you'll write your credentials to environment variables on the local machine running the application.

To set the environment variable for your key and endpoint, open a console window and follow the instructions for your operating system and development environment.

- To set the `CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY` environment variable, replace `YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY` with one of the keys for your resource.
- To set the `CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT` environment variable, replace `YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT` with the endpoint for your resource.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY='YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY'
```

```bash
export CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT='YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT'
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.

                contentSafetyClient.analyzeImage(new AnalyzeImageOptions(image));

        for (ImageCategoriesAnalysis result : response.getCategoriesAnalysis()) {
            System.out.println(result.getCategory() + " severity: " + result.getSeverity());
        }
    }
}
```

Navigate back to the project root folder, and build the app with:

```console
gradle build
```

Then, run it with the `gradle run` command:

```console
gradle run
```

## Output

```console
Hate severity: 0
SelfHarm severity: 0
Sexual severity: 0
Violence severity: 0
```

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn) 
* The current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://aka.ms/acs-create"  title="Create a Content Safety resource"  target="_blank">create a Content Safety resource </a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. Enter a unique name for your resource, select your subscription, and select a resource group, supported region (see [Region availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview#region-availability)), and supported pricing tier. Then select **Create**.
  * The resource takes a few minutes to deploy. After it finishes, Select **go to resource**. In the left pane, under **Resource Management**, select **Subscription Key and Endpoint**. The endpoint and either of the keys are used to call APIs.

## Set up application

Create a new Node.js application. In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it.

```console
mkdir myapp && cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file.

```console
npm init
```

Also create a `/resources` folder at the root of your project, and add a sample image to it.


### Install the client SDK 

Install the `@azure-rest/ai-content-safety` npm package:

```console
npm install @azure-rest/ai-content-safety
```

Also install the `dotenv` module to use environment variables:

```console
npm install dotenv
```

Your app's `package.json` file will be updated with the dependencies.


## Create environment variables 

In this example, you'll write your credentials to environment variables on the local machine running the application.

To set the environment variable for your key and endpoint, open a console window and follow the instructions for your operating system and development environment.

- To set the `CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY` environment variable, replace `YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY` with one of the keys for your resource.
- To set the `CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT` environment variable, replace `YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT` with the endpoint for your resource.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY 'YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY'
```

```console
setx CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT 'YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT'
```

After you add the environment variables, you might need to restart any running programs that will read the environment variables, including the console window.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY='YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY'
```

```bash
export CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT='YOUR_CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT'
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.

## Analyze image content

Create a new file in your directory, *index.js*. Open it in your preferred editor or IDE and paste in the following code. Replace the `image_path` variable with the path to your sample image.

```JavaScript
const ContentSafetyClient = require("@azure-rest/ai-content-safety").default,
  { isUnexpected } = require("@azure-rest/ai-content-safety");
const { AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/core-auth");
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// Load the .env file if it exists
require("dotenv").config();

async function main() {
    // get endpoint and key from environment variables
    const endpoint = process.env["CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT"];
    const key = process.env["CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY"];
    
    const credential = new AzureKeyCredential(key);
    const client = ContentSafetyClient(endpoint, credential);
    
    // replace with your own sample image file path 
    const image_path = path.resolve(__dirname, "./resources/image.jpg");
    
    const imageBuffer = fs.readFileSync(image_path);
    const base64Image = imageBuffer.toString("base64");
    const analyzeImageOption = { image: { content: base64Image } };
    const analyzeImageParameters = { body: analyzeImageOption };
    
    const result = await client.path("/image:analyze").post(analyzeImageParameters);
    
    if (isUnexpected(result)) {
        throw result;
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < result.body.categoriesAnalysis.length; i++) {
    const imageCategoriesAnalysisOutput = result.body.categoriesAnalysis[i];
    console.log(
      imageCategoriesAnalysisOutput.category,
      " severity: ",
      imageCategoriesAnalysisOutput.severity
    );
  }
}

main().catch((err) => {
    console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});
```

Run the application with the `node` command on your quickstart file.

```console
node index.js
```

## Output

```console
Hate severity:  0
SelfHarm severity:  0
Sexual severity:  0
Violence severity:  0
```

} from "@azure-rest/ai-content-safety";
import { AzureKeyCredential } from "@azure/core-auth";
import * as fs from "fs";
import * as path from "path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "url";

// Create __dirname equivalent for ESM modules
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

// Get endpoint and key from environment variables
const endpoint = process.env.CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT;
const key = process.env.CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY;

if (!endpoint || !key) {
    throw new Error("Missing required environment variables CONTENT_SAFETY_ENDPOINT or CONTENT_SAFETY_KEY");
}

try {

    const credential = new AzureKeyCredential(key);
    const client = ContentSafetyClient(endpoint, credential);

    const imagePath = path.join(__dirname, '../resources/image.jpg');

    const imageBuffer = fs.readFileSync(imagePath);
    const base64Image = imageBuffer.toString("base64");
    const analyzeImageOption: AnalyzeImageOptions = { image: { content: base64Image } };
    const analyzeImageParameters: AnalyzeImageParameters = { body: analyzeImageOption };

    const result: AnalyzeImage200Response | AnalyzeImageDefaultResponse = await client.path("/image:analyze").post(analyzeImageParameters);

    if (isUnexpected(result)) {
        throw result;
    }

    const categoriesAnalysis = result.body.categoriesAnalysis as ImageCategoriesAnalysisOutput[];

    for (const analysis of categoriesAnalysis) {
        console.log(`${analysis.category} severity: ${analysis.severity}`);
    }
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error analyzing image:", error);
}
```

## Build and run the sample

1. Compile the TypeScript code:

   ```console
   npm run build
   ```

1. Run the compiled JavaScript:

   ```console
   node dist/index.js
   ```

## Output

```console
Hate severity:  0
SelfHarm severity:  0
Sexual severity:  0
Violence severity:  0
```
