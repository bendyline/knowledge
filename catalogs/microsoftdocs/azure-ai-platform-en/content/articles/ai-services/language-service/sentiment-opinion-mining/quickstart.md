# Quickstart: Sentiment analysis and opinion mining  

**Applies to: programming-language-csharp**


[Reference documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.ai.textanalytics?preserve-view=true\&view=azure-dotnet) | [More samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics/samples) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics/5.2.0) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/textanalytics/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics)

Use this quickstart to create a sentiment analysis application with the client library for .NET. In the following example, you create a C# application that can identify the sentiment(s) expressed in a text sample, and perform aspect-based sentiment analysis.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)
* The [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)



## Setting up

### Create an Azure resource

To use the code sample below, you need to deploy an Azure resource. This resource will contain a key and endpoint you use to authenticate the API calls you send to Azure Language.

1. Use the following link to <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics" target="_blank">create a language resource</a> using the Azure portal. You need to sign in using your Azure subscription.
1. On the **Select additional features** screen that appears, select **Continue to create your resource**.

    A screenshot showing additional feature options in the Azure portal.

1. In the **Create language** screen, provide the following information:

    | Detail | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | The subscription account that your resource will be associated with. Select your Azure subscription from the drop-down menu. |
    | Resource group | A resource group is a container that stores the resources you create. Select **Create new** to create a new resource group. |
    | Region | The location of your Language resource. Different regions may introduce latency depending on your physical location, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource. For this quickstart, either select an available region near you, or choose **East US**. |
    | Name | The name for your Language resource. This name will also be used to create an endpoint URL that your applications will use to send API requests. |
    | Pricing tier | The [pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-service/) for your Language resource. You can use the **Free F0** tier to try the service and upgrade later to a paid tier for production. |
     
    A screenshot showing resource creation details in the Azure portal.

1. Make sure the **Responsible AI Notice** checkbox is checked.
1. Select **Review + Create** at the bottom of the page.

1. In the screen that appears, make sure the validation has passed, and that you entered your information correctly. Then select **Create**. 




### Get your key and endpoint

Next you will need the key and endpoint from the resource to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code later in the quickstart.

1. After Azure Language resource deploys successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**.

    A screenshot showing the next steps after a resource has deployed.

1. On the screen for your resource, select **Keys and endpoint** on the left pane. You will use one of your keys and your endpoint in the steps below. 

    A screenshot showing the keys and endpoint section for a resource.




### Create environment variables 

Your application must be authenticated to send API requests. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. In this example, you will write your credentials to environment variables on the local machine running the application.

To set the environment variable for your Language resource key, open a console window, and follow the instructions for your operating system and development environment. 

- To set the `LANGUAGE_KEY` environment variable, replace `your-key` with one of the keys for your resource.
- To set the `LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT` environment variable, replace `your-endpoint` with the endpoint for your resource.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx LANGUAGE_KEY your-key
```

```console
setx LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT your-endpoint
```

> **Note:**
> If you only need to access the environment variables in the current running console, you can set the environment variable with `set` instead of `setx`.

After you add the environment variables, you might need to restart any running programs that will need to read the environment variables, including the console window. For example, if you're using Visual Studio as your editor, restart Visual Studio before running the example.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export LANGUAGE_KEY=your-key
```

```bash
export LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.

#### [macOS](#tab/macos)

##### Bash

```bash
export LANGUAGE_KEY=your-key
```

```bash
export LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bash_profile` from your console window to make the changes effective.

##### Xcode

For iOS and macOS development, you set the environment variables in Xcode. For example, follow these steps to set the environment variable in Xcode 13.4.1.

1. Select **Product** > **Scheme** > **Edit scheme**
1. Select **Arguments** on the **Run** (Debug Run) page
1. Under **Environment Variables** select the plus (+) sign to add a new environment variable. 
1. Enter `LANGUAGE_KEY` for the **Name** and enter your Language resource key for the **Value**.
1. Perform these steps for your resource endpoint. Name the new environment variable `LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT`.

For more configuration options, see the [Xcode documentation](https://help.apple.com/xcode/#/dev745c5c974).

### Create a new .NET Core application

Using the Visual Studio IDE, create a new .NET Core console app. This creates a "Hello World" project with a single C# source file: *program.cs*.

Install the client library by right-clicking the solution in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Manage NuGet Packages**. In the package manager that opens select **Browse** and search for `Azure.AI.TextAnalytics`. Select version `5.2.0`, and then **Install**. You can also use the [Package Manager Console](https://learn.microsoft.com/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-powershell#find-and-install-a-package).



## Code example

Copy the following code into your *program.cs* file and run the code.

```csharp
using Azure;
using System;
using Azure.AI.TextAnalytics;
using System.Collections.Generic;

namespace Example
{
    class Program
    {
        // This example requires environment variables named "LANGUAGE_KEY" and "LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT"
        static string languageKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LANGUAGE_KEY");
        static string languageEndpoint = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT");

        private static readonly AzureKeyCredential credentials = new AzureKeyCredential(languageKey);
        private static readonly Uri endpoint = new Uri(languageEndpoint);

        // Example method for detecting opinions text. 
        static void SentimentAnalysisWithOpinionMiningExample(TextAnalyticsClient client)
        {
            var documents = new List<string>
            {
                "The food and service were unacceptable. The concierge was nice, however."
            };

            AnalyzeSentimentResultCollection reviews = client.AnalyzeSentimentBatch(documents, options: new AnalyzeSentimentOptions()
            {
                IncludeOpinionMining = true
            });

            foreach (AnalyzeSentimentResult review in reviews)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Document sentiment: {review.DocumentSentiment.Sentiment}\n");
                Console.WriteLine($"\tPositive score: {review.DocumentSentiment.ConfidenceScores.Positive:0.00}");
                Console.WriteLine($"\tNegative score: {review.DocumentSentiment.ConfidenceScores.Negative:0.00}");
                Console.WriteLine($"\tNeutral score: {review.DocumentSentiment.ConfidenceScores.Neutral:0.00}\n");
                foreach (SentenceSentiment sentence in review.DocumentSentiment.Sentences)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine($"\tText: \"{sentence.Text}\"");
                    Console.WriteLine($"\tSentence sentiment: {sentence.Sentiment}");
                    Console.WriteLine($"\tSentence positive score: {sentence.ConfidenceScores.Positive:0.00}");
                    Console.WriteLine($"\tSentence negative score: {sentence.ConfidenceScores.Negative:0.00}");
                    Console.WriteLine($"\tSentence neutral score: {sentence.ConfidenceScores.Neutral:0.00}\n");

                    foreach (SentenceOpinion sentenceOpinion in sentence.Opinions)
                    {
                        Console.WriteLine($"\tTarget: {sentenceOpinion.Target.Text}, Value: {sentenceOpinion.Target.Sentiment}");
                        Console.WriteLine($"\tTarget positive score: {sentenceOpinion.Target.ConfidenceScores.Positive:0.00}");
                        Console.WriteLine($"\tTarget negative score: {sentenceOpinion.Target.ConfidenceScores.Negative:0.00}");
                        foreach (AssessmentSentiment assessment in sentenceOpinion.Assessments)
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tRelated Assessment: {assessment.Text}, Value: {assessment.Sentiment}");
                            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tRelated Assessment positive score: {assessment.ConfidenceScores.Positive:0.00}");
                            Console.WriteLine($"\t\tRelated Assessment negative score: {assessment.ConfidenceScores.Negative:0.00}");
                        }
                    }
                }
                Console.WriteLine($"\n");
            }
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var client = new TextAnalyticsClient(endpoint, credentials);
            SentimentAnalysisWithOpinionMiningExample(client);

            Console.Write("Press any key to exit.");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }

    }
}
```




## Output

```console

Use this quickstart to create a sentiment analysis application with the client library for Node.js. In the following example, you will create a JavaScript application that can identify the sentiment(s) expressed in a text sample, and perform aspect-based sentiment analysis.

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14 LTS or later



## Setting up

### Create an Azure resource

To use the code sample below, you need to deploy an Azure resource. This resource will contain a key and endpoint you use to authenticate the API calls you send to Azure Language.

1. Use the following link to <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics" target="_blank">create a language resource</a> using the Azure portal. You need to sign in using your Azure subscription.
1. On the **Select additional features** screen that appears, select **Continue to create your resource**.

    A screenshot showing additional feature options in the Azure portal.

1. In the **Create language** screen, provide the following information:

    | Detail | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | The subscription account that your resource will be associated with. Select your Azure subscription from the drop-down menu. |
    | Resource group | A resource group is a container that stores the resources you create. Select **Create new** to create a new resource group. |
    | Region | The location of your Language resource. Different regions may introduce latency depending on your physical location, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource. For this quickstart, either select an available region near you, or choose **East US**. |
    | Name | The name for your Language resource. This name will also be used to create an endpoint URL that your applications will use to send API requests. |
    | Pricing tier | The [pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-service/) for your Language resource. You can use the **Free F0** tier to try the service and upgrade later to a paid tier for production. |
     
    A screenshot showing resource creation details in the Azure portal.

1. Make sure the **Responsible AI Notice** checkbox is checked.
1. Select **Review + Create** at the bottom of the page.

1. In the screen that appears, make sure the validation has passed, and that you entered your information correctly. Then select **Create**. 




### Get your key and endpoint

Next you will need the key and endpoint from the resource to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code later in the quickstart.

1. After Azure Language resource deploys successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**.

    A screenshot showing the next steps after a resource has deployed.

1. On the screen for your resource, select **Keys and endpoint** on the left pane. You will use one of your keys and your endpoint in the steps below. 

    A screenshot showing the keys and endpoint section for a resource.




### Create environment variables 

Your application must be authenticated to send API requests. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. In this example, you will write your credentials to environment variables on the local machine running the application.

To set the environment variable for your Language resource key, open a console window, and follow the instructions for your operating system and development environment. 

- To set the `LANGUAGE_KEY` environment variable, replace `your-key` with one of the keys for your resource.
- To set the `LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT` environment variable, replace `your-endpoint` with the endpoint for your resource.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx LANGUAGE_KEY your-key
```

```console
setx LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT your-endpoint
```

> **Note:**
> If you only need to access the environment variables in the current running console, you can set the environment variable with `set` instead of `setx`.

After you add the environment variables, you might need to restart any running programs that will need to read the environment variables, including the console window. For example, if you're using Visual Studio as your editor, restart Visual Studio before running the example.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export LANGUAGE_KEY=your-key
```

```bash
export LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.

#### [macOS](#tab/macos)

##### Bash

```bash
export LANGUAGE_KEY=your-key
```

```bash
export LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bash_profile` from your console window to make the changes effective.

##### Xcode

For iOS and macOS development, you set the environment variables in Xcode. For example, follow these steps to set the environment variable in Xcode 13.4.1.

1. Select **Product** > **Scheme** > **Edit scheme**
1. Select **Arguments** on the **Run** (Debug Run) page
1. Under **Environment Variables** select the plus (+) sign to add a new environment variable. 
1. Enter `LANGUAGE_KEY` for the **Name** and enter your Language resource key for the **Value**.
1. Perform these steps for your resource endpoint. Name the new environment variable `LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT`.

For more configuration options, see the [Xcode documentation](https://help.apple.com/xcode/#/dev745c5c974).

### Create a new Node.js application

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), create a new directory for your app, and navigate to it. 

```console
mkdir myapp 

cd myapp
```

Run the `npm init` command to create a node application with a `package.json` file. 

```console
npm init
```

### Install the client library

Install the npm packages:

```console
npm install @azure/ai-language-text
```



## Code example

Open the file and copy the below code. Then run the code.

```javascript
"use strict";

const { TextAnalyticsClient, AzureKeyCredential } = require("@azure/ai-text-analytics");

// This example requires environment variables named "LANGUAGE_KEY" and "LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT"
const key = process.env.LANGUAGE_KEY;
const endpoint = process.env.LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT;


//an example document for sentiment analysis and opinion mining
const documents = [{
    text: "The food and service were unacceptable. The concierge was nice, however.",
    id: "0",
    language: "en"
  }];
  
async function main() {
  console.log("=== Sentiment analysis and opinion mining sample ===");

  const client = new TextAnalysisClient(endpoint, new AzureKeyCredential(key));

  const results = await client.analyze("SentimentAnalysis", documents, {
    includeOpinionMining: true,
  });

  for (let i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
    const result = results[i];
    console.log(`- Document ${result.id}`);
    if (!result.error) {
      console.log(`\tDocument text: ${documents[i].text}`);
      console.log(`\tOverall Sentiment: ${result.sentiment}`);
      console.log("\tSentiment confidence scores:", result.confidenceScores);
      console.log("\tSentences");
      for (const { sentiment, confidenceScores, opinions } of result.sentences) {
        console.log(`\t- Sentence sentiment: ${sentiment}`);
        console.log("\t  Confidence scores:", confidenceScores);
        console.log("\t  Mined opinions");
        for (const { target, assessments } of opinions) {
          console.log(`\t\t- Target text: ${target.text}`);
          console.log(`\t\t  Target sentiment: ${target.sentiment}`);
          console.log("\t\t  Target confidence scores:", target.confidenceScores);
          console.log("\t\t  Target assessments");
          for (const { text, sentiment } of assessments) {
            console.log(`\t\t\t- Text: ${text}`);
            console.log(`\t\t\t  Sentiment: ${sentiment}`);
          }
        }
      }
    } else {
      console.error(`\tError: ${result.error}`);
    }
  }
}
  
main().catch((err) => {
  console.error("The sample encountered an error:", err);
});
```

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx LANGUAGE_KEY your-key
```

```console
setx LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT your-endpoint
```

> **Note:**
> If you only need to access the environment variables in the current running console, you can set the environment variable with `set` instead of `setx`.

After you add the environment variables, you might need to restart any running programs that will need to read the environment variables, including the console window. For example, if you're using Visual Studio as your editor, restart Visual Studio before running the example.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export LANGUAGE_KEY=your-key
```

```bash
export LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.

#### [macOS](#tab/macos)

##### Bash

```bash
export LANGUAGE_KEY=your-key
```

```bash
export LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bash_profile` from your console window to make the changes effective.

##### Xcode

For iOS and macOS development, you set the environment variables in Xcode. For example, follow these steps to set the environment variable in Xcode 13.4.1.

1. Select **Product** > **Scheme** > **Edit scheme**
1. Select **Arguments** on the **Run** (Debug Run) page
1. Under **Environment Variables** select the plus (+) sign to add a new environment variable. 
1. Enter `LANGUAGE_KEY` for the **Name** and enter your Language resource key for the **Value**.
1. Perform these steps for your resource endpoint. Name the new environment variable `LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT`.

For more configuration options, see the [Xcode documentation](https://help.apple.com/xcode/#/dev745c5c974).

## Create a JSON file with the example request body

In a code editor, create a new file named `test_sentiment_payload.json` and copy the following JSON example. This example request will be sent to the API in the next step.

```json
{
 "kind": "SentimentAnalysis",
 "parameters": {
  "modelVersion": "latest",
  "opinionMining": "True"
 },
 "analysisInput":{
  "documents":[
   {
    "id":"1",
    "language":"en",
    "text": "The food and service were unacceptable. The concierge was nice, however."
   }
  ]
 }
} 
```

Save `test_sentiment_payload.json` somewhere on your computer. For example, your desktop.  

## Send a sentiment analysis and opinion mining API request

> **Note:**
> The below examples include a request for the opinion mining feature of sentiment analysis, which provides granular information about assessments (adjectives) related to targets (nouns) in the text.

Use the following commands to send the API request using the program you're using. Copy the command into your terminal, and run it.

| parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-X POST <endpoint>` | Specifies your endpoint for accessing the API. |
| `-H Content-Type: application/json` | The content type for sending JSON data. |
| `-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key:<key>` | Specifies the key for accessing the API. |
| `-d <documents>` | The JSON file containing the documents you want to send. |

# [Windows](#tab/windows)

 Replace `C:\Users\<myaccount>\Desktop\test_sentiment_payload.json` with the location of the example JSON request file you created in the previous step.

### Command prompt

```terminal
curl -X POST "%LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT%/language/:analyze-text?api-version=2023-04-15-preview" ^
-H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: %LANGUAGE_KEY%" ^
-d "@C:\Users\<myaccount>\Desktop\test_sentiment_payload.json"
```

### PowerShell

```terminal
curl.exe -X POST $env:LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT/language/:analyze-text?api-version=2023-04-15-preview `

-d "@C:\Users\<myaccount>\Desktop\test_sentiment_payload.json"
```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

Use the following commands to send the API request using the program you're using. Replace `/home/mydir/test_sentiment_payload.json` with the location of the example JSON request file you created in the previous step.

```terminal
curl -X POST $LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT/language/:analyze-text?api-version=2023-04-15-preview \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: $LANGUAGE_KEY" \
-d "@/home/mydir/test_sentiment_payload.json"
```

#### [macOS](#tab/macos)

Use the following commands to send the API request using the program you're using. Replace `/home/mydir/test_sentiment_payload.json` with the location of the example JSON request file you created in the previous step.

```terminal
curl -X POST $LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT/language/:analyze-text?api-version=2023-04-15-preview \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: $LANGUAGE_KEY" \
-d "@/home/mydir/test_sentiment_payload.json"

## Clean up resources

To clean up and remove an Azure AI resource, you can delete either the individual resource or the entire resource group. If you delete the resource group, all resources contained within are also deleted.

* [Azure portal](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azportal#clean-up-resources)
* [Azure CLI](../../multi-service-resource.md?pivots=azcli#clean-up-resources)


Use the following commands to delete the environment variables you created for this quickstart.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
reg delete "HKCU\Environment" /v LANGUAGE_KEY /f
```

```console
reg delete "HKCU\Environment" /v LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT /f
```

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
unset LANGUAGE_KEY
```

```bash
unset LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT
```

#### [macOS](#tab/macos)

```bash
unset LANGUAGE_KEY
```

```bash
unset LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT
```

## Navigate to the Foundry Playground

Using the left side pane, select **Playgrounds**. Then select the **Try Azure Language Playground** button.

The development lifecycle

## Use Sentiment Analysis in the Foundry Playground

The **Language Playground** consists of four sections:

* Top banner: You can select any of the currently available Languages here.
* Right pane: This pane is where you can find the **Configuration** options for the service, such as the API and model version, along with features specific to the service.
* Center pane: This pane is where you enter your text for processing. After the operation is run, some results are shown here.
* Right pane: This pane is where **Details** of the run operation are shown.

Here you can select the Sentiment Analysis capability by choosing the top banner tile, **Analyze sentiment**.

## Use Analyze sentiment

**Analyze sentiment** is designed to identify positive, negative and neutral sentiment in text.

In **Configuration** there are the following options:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Select API version | Select which version of the API to use. |
| Select model version | Select which version of the model to use. |
| Select text language | Select the language of the input text. |
| Enable opinion mining | Enables or disables the opinion mining skill. |

After your operation is completed, in the center pane, each sentence will be numbered and opinions will be labeled if **Enable opinion mining** was checked and the **Details** section contains the following fields for the overall sentiment and the sentiment of each sentence:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Sentence number | The number of the sentence in the order it was typed. This field is not present for **Overall sentiment**. |
| Sentiment | The detected overall sentiment for the segment of text. |
| Scores | The amount of positive, neutral and negative sentiment detected in the text segment. |

The following fields are only present if opinion mining is enabled:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Target | The target of the detected opinion. |
| Assessments | The detected opinion and the detected persuasion (positive, neutral, negative), as well as the percent of detected persuasion. |
