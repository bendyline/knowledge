[Reference documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azure-ai-textanalytics/azure.ai.textanalytics?preserve-view=true\&view=azure-python) | [More samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/samples) | [Package (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/project/azure-ai-textanalytics/5.2.0/) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/main/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics)

Use this quickstart to create an entity linking application with the client library for Python. In the following example, you create a Python application that can identify and disambiguate entities found in text.


## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?cid=msft_learn)
* [Python 3.7 or later](https://www.python.org/)


## Setting up

### Create an Azure resource

To use the code sample below, you need to deploy an Azure resource. This resource will contain a key and endpoint you use to authenticate the API calls you send to Azure Language.

1. Use the following link to <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics" target="_blank">create a language resource</a> using the Azure portal. You need to sign in using your Azure subscription.
1. On the **Select additional features** screen that appears, select **Continue to create your resource**.

1. In the **Create language** screen, provide the following information:

    | Detail | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Subscription | The subscription account that your resource will be associated with. Select your Azure subscription from the drop-down menu. |
    | Resource group | A resource group is a container that stores the resources you create. Select **Create new** to create a new resource group. |
    | Region | The location of your Language resource. Different regions may introduce latency depending on your physical location, but have no impact on the runtime availability of your resource. For this quickstart, either select an available region near you, or choose **East US**. |
    | Name | The name for your Language resource. This name will also be used to create an endpoint URL that your applications will use to send API requests. |
    | Pricing tier | The [pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-service/) for your Language resource. You can use the **Free F0** tier to try the service and upgrade later to a paid tier for production. |

1. Make sure the **Responsible AI Notice** checkbox is checked.
1. Select **Review + Create** at the bottom of the page.

1. In the screen that appears, make sure the validation has passed, and that you entered your information correctly. Then select **Create**. 




### Get your key and endpoint

Next you will need the key and endpoint from the resource to connect your application to the API. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code later in the quickstart.

1. After Azure Language resource deploys successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**.

    A screenshot showing the next steps after a resource has deployed.

1. On the screen for your resource, select **Keys and endpoint** on the left pane. You will use one of your keys and your endpoint in the steps below.

### Create environment variables 

Your application must be authenticated to send API requests. For production, use a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. In this example, you will write your credentials to environment variables on the local machine running the application.

To set the environment variable for your Language resource key, open a console window, and follow the instructions for your operating system and development environment. 

- To set the `LANGUAGE_KEY` environment variable, replace `your-key` with one of the keys for your resource.
- To set the `LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT` environment variable, replace `your-endpoint` with the endpoint for your resource.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx LANGUAGE_KEY your-key
```

```console
setx LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT your-endpoint
```

> **Note:**
> If you only need to access the environment variables in the current running console, you can set the environment variable with `set` instead of `setx`.

After you add the environment variables, you might need to restart any running programs that will need to read the environment variables, including the console window. For example, if you're using Visual Studio as your editor, restart Visual Studio before running the example.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export LANGUAGE_KEY=your-key
```

```bash
export LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.

#### [macOS](#tab/macos)

##### Bash

```bash
export LANGUAGE_KEY=your-key
```

```bash
export LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT=your-endpoint
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bash_profile` from your console window to make the changes effective.

##### Xcode

For iOS and macOS development, you set the environment variables in Xcode. For example, follow these steps to set the environment variable in Xcode 13.4.1.

1. Select **Product** > **Scheme** > **Edit scheme**
1. Select **Arguments** on the **Run** (Debug Run) page
1. Under **Environment Variables** select the plus (+) sign to add a new environment variable. 
1. Enter `LANGUAGE_KEY` for the **Name** and enter your Language resource key for the **Value**.
1. Perform these steps for your resource endpoint. Name the new environment variable `LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT`.

For more configuration options, see the [Xcode documentation](https://help.apple.com/xcode/#/dev745c5c974).

### Install the client library

After installing Python, you can install the client library with:

```console
pip install azure-ai-textanalytics==5.2.0
```



## Code example

Create a new Python file and copy the below code. Then run the code. 

```python
# This example requires environment variables named "LANGUAGE_KEY" and "LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT"
language_key = os.environ.get('LANGUAGE_KEY')
language_endpoint = os.environ.get('LANGUAGE_ENDPOINT')

from azure.ai.textanalytics import TextAnalyticsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# Authenticate the client using your key and endpoint. 
def authenticate_client():
    ta_credential = AzureKeyCredential(language_key)
    text_analytics_client = TextAnalyticsClient(
            endpoint=language_endpoint, 
            credential=ta_credential)
    return text_analytics_client

client = authenticate_client()

# Example function for recognizing entities and providing a link to an online data source.
def entity_linking_example(client):

    try:
        documents = ["""Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975, 
        to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800. 
        During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman,
        chief executive officer, president and chief software architect, 
        while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014."""]
        result = client.recognize_linked_entities(documents = documents)[0]

        print("Linked Entities:\n")
        for entity in result.entities:
            print("\tName: ", entity.name, "\tId: ", entity.data_source_entity_id, "\tUrl: ", entity.url,
            "\n\tData Source: ", entity.data_source)
            print("\tMatches:")
            for match in entity.matches:
                print("\t\tText:", match.text)
                print("\t\tConfidence Score: {0:.2f}".format(match.confidence_score))
                print("\t\tOffset: {}".format(match.offset))
                print("\t\tLength: {}".format(match.length))
            
    except Exception as err:
        print("Encountered exception. {}".format(err))
entity_linking_example(client)
```

## Clean up resources

To clean up and remove an Azure AI resource, you can delete either the individual resource or the entire resource group. If you delete the resource group, all resources contained within are also deleted.
