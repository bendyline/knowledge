## Create environment variables 

In this example, write your credentials to environment variables on the local machine that runs the application.


Go to the Azure portal. If the resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, select **Go to resource** under **Next steps**. You can find your key and endpoint under **Resource Management** on the **Keys and Endpoint** page of the Face resource. Your resource key isn't the same as your Azure subscription ID.


To set the environment variable for your key and endpoint, open a console window and follow the instructions for your operating system and development environment.

- To set the `VISION_KEY` environment variable, replace `<your_key>` with one of the keys for your resource.
- To set the `VISION_ENDPOINT` environment variable, replace `<your_endpoint>` with the endpoint for your resource.

#### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```console
setx VISION_KEY <your_key>
```

```console
setx VISION_ENDPOINT <your_endpoint>
```

After you add the environment variables, you might need to restart any running programs that will read the environment variables, including the console window.

#### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```bash
export VISION_KEY=<your_key>
```

```bash
export VISION_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint>
```

After you add the environment variables, run `source ~/.bashrc` from your console window to make the changes effective.
