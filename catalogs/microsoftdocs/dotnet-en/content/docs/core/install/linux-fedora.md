# Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime on Fedora

.NET is supported on Fedora and this article describes how to install .NET on Fedora. When a Fedora version falls out of support, .NET is no longer supported with that version.


Install the SDK (which includes the runtime) if you want to develop .NET apps. Or, if you only need to run apps, install the Runtime. If you're installing the Runtime, we suggest you install the **ASP.NET Core Runtime** as it includes both .NET and ASP.NET Core runtimes.

Use the `dotnet --list-sdks` and `dotnet --list-runtimes` commands to see which versions are installed. For more information, see [How to check that .NET is already installed](how-to-detect-installed-versions.md).


For more information on installing .NET without a package manager, see one of the following articles:

- [Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime with a script.](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime manually.](linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)

## Supported distributions

The following table is a list of currently supported .NET releases and the versions of Fedora they're supported on. These versions remain supported until either the version of [.NET reaches end-of-support](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) or the version of [Fedora reaches end-of-life](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/End_of_life).

| Fedora | .NET |
| --- | --- |
| 44 | 10, 9, 8 |
| 43 | 10, 9, 8 |


The following versions of .NET are ❌ no longer supported:

- .NET 7
- .NET 6
- .NET 5
- .NET Core 3.1
- .NET Core 3.0
- .NET Core 2.2
- .NET Core 2.1
- .NET Core 2.0


# [.NET 10](#tab/dotnet10)


> **Important:**
> .NET 10 was released on November 11, 2025. It may take time for the packages to appear in the package manager feeds or for your specific Linux distribution to include it.



### Install the SDK

The .NET SDK allows you to develop apps with .NET. If you install the .NET SDK, you don't need to install the corresponding runtime. To install the .NET SDK, run the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install dotnet-sdk-10.0
```

To learn how to use the .NET CLI, see [.NET CLI overview](../tools/index.md).

### Install the runtime

The ASP.NET Core Runtime allows you to run apps that were made with .NET that didn't provide the runtime. The following command installs the ASP.NET Core Runtime, which is the most compatible runtime for .NET. In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install aspnetcore-runtime-10.0
```

As an alternative to the ASP.NET Core Runtime, you can install the .NET Runtime, which doesn't include ASP.NET Core support: replace `aspnetcore-runtime-10.0` in the previous command with `dotnet-runtime-10.0`:

```bash
sudo dnf install dotnet-runtime-10.0
```

To learn how to use the .NET CLI, see [.NET CLI overview](../tools/index.md).


# [.NET 9](#tab/dotnet9)


### Install the SDK

The .NET SDK allows you to develop apps with .NET. If you install the .NET SDK, you don't need to install the corresponding runtime. To install the .NET SDK, run the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install dotnet-sdk-9.0
```

To learn how to use the .NET CLI, see [.NET CLI overview](../tools/index.md).

### Install the runtime

The ASP.NET Core Runtime allows you to run apps that were made with .NET that didn't provide the runtime. The following command installs the ASP.NET Core Runtime, which is the most compatible runtime for .NET. In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install aspnetcore-runtime-9.0
```

As an alternative to the ASP.NET Core Runtime, you can install the .NET Runtime, which doesn't include ASP.NET Core support: replace `aspnetcore-runtime-9.0` in the previous command with `dotnet-runtime-9.0`:

```bash
sudo dnf install dotnet-runtime-9.0
```

To learn how to use the .NET CLI, see [.NET CLI overview](../tools/index.md).


# [.NET 8](#tab/dotnet8)


### Install the SDK

The .NET SDK allows you to develop apps with .NET. If you install the .NET SDK, you don't need to install the corresponding runtime. To install the .NET SDK, run the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install dotnet-sdk-8.0
```

To learn how to use the .NET CLI, see [.NET CLI overview](../tools/index.md).

### Install the runtime

The ASP.NET Core Runtime allows you to run apps that were made with .NET that didn't provide the runtime. The following command installs the ASP.NET Core Runtime, which is the most compatible runtime for .NET. In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install aspnetcore-runtime-8.0
```

## Install preview versions


Preview and release candidate versions of .NET aren't available in package repositories. You can install previews and release candidates of .NET in one of the following ways:

- [Scripted install with *install-dotnet.sh*](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Manual binary extraction](linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)


## Remove preview versions


When using a package manager to manage your installation of .NET, you may run into a conflict if you've previously installed a preview release. The package manager may interpret the non-preview release as an earlier version of .NET. To install the non-preview release, first uninstall the preview versions. For more information about uninstalling .NET, see [How to remove the .NET Runtime and SDK](remove-runtime-sdk-versions.md?pivots=os-linux#uninstall-net).


## Dependencies

.NET depends on various Linux packages for different functionality. The following packages are required:

- glibc
- libgcc
- ca-certificates
- openssl-libs
- libstdc++
- libicu
- tzdata
- krb5-libs
- zlib (required for .NET 8 only)

You can install all the required packages with the following command:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y glibc libgcc ca-certificates openssl-libs libstdc++ libicu tzdata krb5-libs zlib
```

## How to install other versions


All versions of .NET are available for download at <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet>, but require [manual installation](linux-scripted-manual.md). You can try to use the package manager to install a different version of .NET. However, the requested version might not be available.

The packages added to package manager feeds are named in a hackable format, for example: `{product}-{type}-{version}`.

- **product**\
The type of .NET product to install. Valid options are:

  - `dotnet`
  - `aspnetcore`

- **type**\
Chooses the SDK or the runtime. Valid options are:

  - `sdk` (only available for the **dotnet** product)
  - `runtime`

- **version**\
The version of the SDK or runtime to install. Valid options are any released version, such as:

  - `9.0`
  - `8.0`
  - `3.1`
  - `2.1`

  It's possible the SDK/runtime you're trying to download isn't available for your Linux distribution. For a list of supported distributions, see [Install .NET on Linux](linux.md).

### Examples

- Install the ASP.NET Core 9.0 runtime: `aspnetcore-runtime-9.0`
- Install the .NET Core 2.1 runtime: `dotnet-runtime-2.1`
- Install the .NET 5 SDK: `dotnet-sdk-5.0`
- Install the .NET Core 3.1 SDK: `dotnet-sdk-3.1`

> **Note:**
> Some package might not be available on your Linux distribution.

### Package missing

If the package-version combination doesn't work, it's not available. For example, there isn't an ASP.NET Core SDK. The SDK components for ASP.NET Core are included with the .NET SDK. The value `aspnetcore-sdk-8.0` is incorrect and should be `dotnet-sdk-8.0`. For a list of Linux distributions supported by .NET, see [.NET dependencies and requirements](linux.md).


## Troubleshoot the package manager

This section provides information on common errors you may get while using the package manager to install .NET or .NET Core.

### Unable to find package

For more information on installing .NET without a package manager, see one of the following articles:

- [Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime with a script.](linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime manually.](linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)

### Failed to fetch


While installing the .NET package, you may see an error similar to `signature verification failed for file 'repomd.xml' from repository 'packages-microsoft-com-prod'`. Generally speaking, this error means that the package feed for .NET is being upgraded with newer package versions, and that you should try again later. During an upgrade, the package feed should not be unavailable for more than 2 hours. If you continually receive this error for more than 2 hours, please file an issue at <https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues>.


### Errors related to missing `fxr`, `libhostfxr.so`, `FrameworkList.xml`, or `/usr/share/dotnet`

For more information about solving these problems, see [Troubleshoot `fxr`, `libhostfxr.so`, and `FrameworkList.xml` errors](linux-package-mixup.md).
