# IXCLRDataMethodDefinition::Request Method

Requests to populate the buffer given with the method's data.

> **Note:**
> This API was originally designed for internal use in the runtime. Although it is now supported for 3rd party use, we recommend working with [`ICorDebug`](debugging-interfaces.md) and [`ICorProfiler`](../profiling/profiling-interfaces.md) APIs when possible.


## Syntax

```cpp
HRESULT Request(
    [in] ULONG32 reqCode,
    [in] ULONG32 inBufferSize,
    [in, size_is(inBufferSize)] BYTE* inBuffer,
    [in] ULONG32 outBufferSize,
    [out, size_is(outBufferSize)] BYTE* outBuffer);
```

## Parameters

`reqCode`\
[in] Request type to be sent.

Requests can be one of the following:

| Member | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CLRDATA_REQUEST_REVISION` | 0xe0000000 | Request the revision of the method.  The revision is a ULONG32 numeric value. |

`inBufferSize`\
[in] size of the input buffer to be passed in.

`inBuffer`\
[in, size_is(inBufferSize)] Buffer pointer for the raw data to be sent in the request.

`outBufferSize`\
[in] Size of the output buffer.

`outBuffer`\
[out, size_is(outBufferSize)] Buffer pointer to used to store the request response.

## Remarks

The provided method is part of the `IXCLRDataMethodDefinition` interface and corresponds to the 18th slot of the virtual method table.

## Requirements

**Platforms:** See [System Requirements](../../get-started/system-requirements.md).
