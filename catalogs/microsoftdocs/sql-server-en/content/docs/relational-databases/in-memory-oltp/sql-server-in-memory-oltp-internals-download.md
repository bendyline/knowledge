## In-Memory OLTP

In-Memory OLTP helps you take advantage of large amounts of memory and many dozens of cores to increase performance for OLTP operations by up to 30 to 40 times. This article describes the implementation of SQL Server 2016's In-memory OLTP technology as of SQL Server 2016 RTM.

Use In-Memory OLTP to declare memory optimized tables, which are fully transactional and accessible by using Transact-SQL. Compile Transact-SQL stored procedures, triggers, and scalar UDFs to machine code for further performance improvements on memory-optimized tables. The engine is designed for high concurrency with no blocking.
