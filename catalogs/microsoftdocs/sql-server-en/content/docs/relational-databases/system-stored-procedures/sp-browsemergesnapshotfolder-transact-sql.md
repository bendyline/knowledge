# sys.sp_browsemergesnapshotfolder (Transact-SQL)


**Applies to:**
 

](../../sql-server/sql-docs-navigation-guide.md#applies-to)
 

Returns the complete path for the latest snapshot generated for a merge publication. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.



## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sys.sp_browsemergesnapshotfolder [ @publication = ] N'publication'
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @publication = ] N'*publication*'

The name of the publication. *@publication* is **sysname**, with no default.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Result set

| Column name | Data type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `snapshot_folder` | **nvarchar(2000)** | Full path to the snapshot directory. |

## Remarks

`sp_browsemergesnapshotfolder` is used in merge replication.

If the publication is set up to generate snapshot files in both the Publisher working directory and Publisher snapshot folder, the result set contains two rows: the first row contains the publication snapshot folder, and the second row contains the publisher working directory.

`sp_browsemergesnapshotfolder` is useful for determining the directory where the merge snapshot files are generated. This folder/path and its contents can then be copied to removable media, and the snapshot used to synchronize a subscription from an alternate snapshot location.

## Permissions

Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role or **db_owner** fixed database role can execute `sp_browsemergesnapshotfolder`.
