# sys.sp_restoredbreplication (Transact-SQL)


**Applies to:**
 

](../../sql-server/sql-docs-navigation-guide.md#applies-to)
 





Removes replication settings if restoring a database to the non-originating server, database, or system that is otherwise not capable of running replication processes. When restoring a replicated database to a server or database other than the one where the backup was taken, replication settings can't be preserved. On the restore, the server calls `sp_restoredbreplication` directly to automatically remove replication metadata from the restored database.



## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sys.sp_restoredbreplication
    [ @srv_orig = ] N'srv_orig'
    , [ @db_orig = ] N'db_orig'
    [ , [ @keep_replication = ] keep_replication ]
    [ , [ @perform_upgrade = ] perform_upgrade ]
    [ , [ @recoveryforklsn = ] recoveryforklsn ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @srv_orig = ] N'*srv_orig*'

#### [ @db_orig = ] N'*db_orig*'

The name of the database that was backed up. *@db_orig* is **sysname**, with no default.
