# sys.sp_repldropcolumn (Transact-SQL)


**Applies to:**
 

](../../sql-server/sql-docs-navigation-guide.md#applies-to)
 





Drops a column from an existing table article that was published. This stored procedure is executed at the Publisher on the publication database.

> **Important:**  
> This stored procedure has been deprecated and is being supported mainly for backward-compatibility. It should only be used with  SQL Server 2000 (8.x) 
 Publishers and  SQL Server 2000 (8.x) 
 republishing Subscribers. This procedure shouldn't be used on columns with data types that were introduced in  SQL Server 2005 (9.x) 
 and later versions.



## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sys.sp_repldropcolumn
    [ @source_object = ] N'source_object'
    , [ @column = ] N'column'
    [ , [ @from_agent = ] from_agent ]
    [ , [ @schema_change_script = ] N'schema_change_script' ]
    [ , [ @force_invalidate_snapshot = ] force_invalidate_snapshot ]
    [ , [ @force_reinit_subscription = ] force_reinit_subscription ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @source_object = ] N'*source_object*'

The name of the table article that contains the column to drop. *@source_object* is **nvarchar(270)**, with no default.

#### [ @column = ] N'*column*'

The name of the column in the table to be dropped. *@column* is **sysname**, with no default.

#### [ @from_agent = ] *from_agent*

Specifies whether the stored procedure is being executed by a replication agent. *@from_agent* is **int**, with a default of `0`.

Use `1` when this stored procedure is being executed by a replication agent, otherwise use the default value of `0`.

#### [ @schema_change_script = ] N'*schema_change_script*'

Specifies the name and path of a  SQL Server 
 script used to modify the system generated custom stored procedures. *@schema_change_script* is **nvarchar(4000)**, with a default of `NULL`.

Replication allows user-defined custom stored procedures to replace one or more of the default procedures used in transactional replication. *@schema_change_script* is executed after a schema change is made to a replicated table article using `sp_repldropcolumn`, and can be used for one of the following options:

- If custom stored procedures are automatically regenerated, *@schema_change_script* can be used to drop these custom stored procedures and replace them with user-defined custom stored procedures that support the new schema.

- If custom stored procedures aren't automatically regenerated, *@schema_change_script*can be used to regenerate these stored procedures or to create user-defined custom stored procedures.

#### [ @force_invalidate_snapshot = ] *force_invalidate_snapshot*

Enables or disables the ability to have a snapshot invalidated. *@force_invalidate_snapshot* is **bit**, with a default of `1`.

- `1` specifies that changes to the article might cause the snapshot to be invalid, and if that is the case, a value of `1` gives permission for the new snapshot to occur.

- `0` specifies that changes to the article don't cause the snapshot to be invalid.

#### [ @force_reinit_subscription = ] *force_reinit_subscription*

Enables or disables the ability to have the subscription reinitialized. *@force_reinit_subscription* is **bit**, with a default of `0`.

- `0` specifies that changes to the article don't cause the subscription to be reinitialized.

- `1` specifies that changes to the article might cause the subscription to be reinitialized, and if that is the case, a value of `1` gives permission for the subscription reinitialization to occur.

## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Permissions

Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role at the Publisher or members of the **db_owner** or **db_ddladmin** fixed database roles on the publication database can execute `sp_repldropcolumn`.
