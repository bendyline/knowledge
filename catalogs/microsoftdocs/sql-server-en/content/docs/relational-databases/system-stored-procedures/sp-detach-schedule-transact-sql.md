# sp_detach_schedule (Transact-SQL)


**Applies to:**
 

](../../sql-server/sql-docs-navigation-guide.md#applies-to)
 

Removes an association between a schedule and a job.



## Syntax

```syntaxsql
dbo.sp_detach_schedule
    { [ @job_id = ] 'job_id'
        | [ @job_name = ] N'job_name' }
    , { [ @schedule_id = ] schedule_id
        | [ @schedule_name = ] N'schedule_name' }
    [ , [ @delete_unused_schedule = ] delete_unused_schedule ]
    [ , [ @automatic_post = ] automatic_post ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @job_id = ] '*job_id*'

The job identification number of the job to remove the schedule from. *@job_id* is **uniqueidentifier**, with a default of `NULL`.

Either *@job_id* or *@job_name* must be specified, but both can't be specified.

#### [ @job_name = ] N'*job_name*'

The name of the job to remove the schedule from. *@job_name* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`.

Either *@job_id* or *@job_name* must be specified, but both can't be specified.

#### [ @schedule_id = ] *schedule_id*

The schedule identification number of the schedule to remove from the job. *@schedule_id* is **int**, with a default of `NULL`.

Either *@schedule_id* or *@schedule_name* must be specified, but both can't be specified.

#### [ @schedule_name = ] N'*schedule_name*'

The name of the schedule to remove from the job. *@schedule_name* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`.

Either *@schedule_id* or *@schedule_name* must be specified, but both can't be specified.

#### [ @delete_unused_schedule = ] *delete_unused_schedule*

Specifies whether to delete unused job schedules. *@delete_unused_schedule* is **bit**, with a default of `0`, which means that all schedules are kept, even if no jobs reference them. If set to `1`, unused job schedules are deleted if no jobs reference them.

#### [ @automatic_post = ] *automatic_post*

 Identified for informational purposes only. Not supported. Future compatibility is not guaranteed. 


## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Result set

None.

## Permissions

You can grant `EXECUTE` permissions on this procedure, but these permissions might be overridden during a SQL Server upgrade.


Other users must be granted one of the following  SQL Server 
 Agent fixed database roles in the `msdb` database:

- **SQLAgentUserRole**
- **SQLAgentReaderRole**
- **SQLAgentOperatorRole**

The job owner can attach a job to a schedule and detach a job from a schedule without also having to be the schedule owner. However, a schedule can't be deleted if the detach would leave it with no jobs unless the caller is the schedule owner.

For details about the permissions of these roles, see [SQL Server Agent Fixed Database Roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/ssms/agent/sql-server-agent-fixed-database-roles).

 SQL Server 
 checks to determine whether the user owns the schedule. Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can detach schedules from jobs owned by another user.

## Examples

The following example removes an association between a `NightlyJobs` schedule and a `BackupDatabase` job.

```sql
USE msdb;
GO

EXECUTE dbo.sp_detach_schedule
    @job_name = 'BackupDatabase',
    @schedule_name = 'NightlyJobs';
GO
```
