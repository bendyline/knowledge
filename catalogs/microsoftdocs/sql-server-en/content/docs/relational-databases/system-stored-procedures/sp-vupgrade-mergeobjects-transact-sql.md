# sys.sp_vupgrade_mergeobjects (Transact-SQL)


**Applies to:**
 

](../../sql-server/sql-docs-navigation-guide.md#applies-to)
 

Regenerates the article-specific triggers, stored procedures, and views that are used to track and apply data changes for merge replication. Execute this procedure in the following situations:

- If an object required by replication is accidentally dropped.

- If you apply an update, such as a hotfix, which requires modification to one or more replication objects. Execute the procedure on each node after applying the update.

Executing this stored procedure doesn't require reinitialization of subscriptions. This procedure isn't required if you install a service pack or upgrade to a new version of  SQL Server 
.



## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sys.sp_vupgrade_mergeobjects
    [ [ @login = ] N'login' ]
    [ , [ @password = ] N'password' ]
    [ , [ @security_mode = ] security_mode ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @login = ] N'*login*'

The system administrator login to use when creating new system objects in the distribution database. *@login* is **sysname**, with a default of `NULL`. This parameter isn't required if *@security_mode* is set to `1`, which is Windows Authentication.

#### [ @password = ] N'*password*'

The system administrator password to use when creating new system objects in the distribution database. *@password* is **sysname**, with a default of an empty string. This parameter isn't required if *@security_mode* is set to `1`, which is Windows Authentication.

#### [ @security_mode = ] *security_mode*

The login security mode to use when creating new system objects in the distribution database. *@security_mode* is **bit**, with a default of `1`. If `0`,  SQL Server 
 Authentication is used. If `1`, Windows Authentication is used.  When possible, use Windows authentication. 


## Return code values

`0` (success) or `1` (failure).

## Remarks

`sp_vupgrade_mergeobjects` is used only for merge replication.

## Permissions
