# sys.sp_delete_backup (Transact-SQL)


**Applies to:**
 

 and later versions

Deletes all snapshots and the backup file that comprise a snapshot backup set from the specified database. This system stored procedure is the only recommended method for managing snapshot backup sets. For more information, see [File-Snapshot Backups for Database Files in Azure](../backup-restore/file-snapshot-backups-for-database-files-in-azure.md).



## Syntax

```syntaxsql
sys.sp_delete_backup
    [ @backup_url = ] N'backup_url'
    [ , [ @database_name = ] { N'database_name' | NULL } ]
[ ; ]
```

## Arguments

#### [ @backup_url = ] N'*backup_url*'

The URL of the backup to be deleted, which deletes all snapshots comprising the specified backup set including the backup file itself.

#### [ @database_name = ] N'*database_name*'

The name of the database containing the snapshot to be deleted. When a database name is provided, the system verifies that the backup URL provided is a backup URL for the specified database and uses [sp_delete_backup_file_snapshot](snapshot-backup-sp-delete-backup-file-snapshot.md) to delete each snapshot. If no database name is provided, this database check isn't performed.

## Permissions

Requires ALTER ANY DATABASE permission or ALTER permission on the specified database.
