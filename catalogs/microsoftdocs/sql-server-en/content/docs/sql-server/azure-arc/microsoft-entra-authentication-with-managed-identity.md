This article provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and configuring Microsoft Entra ID managed identity for SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc.

For an overview of managed identity with SQL Server, see [Managed identity for SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc](managed-identity.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you can use a managed identity with SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc, make sure that you meet the following prerequisites:

- Supported for SQL Server 2025 and later, running on Windows.
- [Connect your SQL Server to Azure Arc](connect.md).
- The latest version of the [Azure Extension for SQL Server](release-notes.md).

## Enable the primary managed identity

If you've installed the Azure Extension for SQL Server to your server, you can enable the primary managed identity for your SQL Server instance directly from the Azure portal. It's also possible to enable the primary managed identity manually by updating the registry, but should be done with extreme caution.

### [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

To enable the primary managed identity in the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. Go to your [SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ArcCenterUX/ArcCenterMenuBlade/~/sqlServerInstances) resource in the Azure portal.
1. Under **Settings**, select **Microsoft Entra ID and Purview** to open the **Microsoft Entra ID and Purview** page.

   > **Note:**  
   > If you don't see the **Enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication** option, ensure that your SQL Server instance is connected to Azure Arc and that you have the latest SQL extension installed.

1. On the **Microsoft Entra ID and Purview** page, check the box next to **Use a primary managed identity** and then use **Save** to apply your configuration:

### [Manually](#tab/manual)

It's possible to manually enable the primary managed identity for your SQL Server instance by updating the registry, but should be done with extreme caution.

### Grant permission to the Tokens folder

Grant **Read & execute** operating system permissions on the folder `C:\ProgramData\AzureConnectedMachineAgent\Tokens\` to the SQL Server 2025 instance service account. By default, the service account is `NT Service\MSSQLSERVER`, or for named instances, `NT Service\MSSQL$<instancename>`.

### Add SQL Server service account to the Hybrid agent extension applications group

Add the SQL Server service account (default: `NT Service\MSSQLSERVER` or for named instances, `NT Service\MSSQL$instancename`) to the **Hybrid agent extension applications** group.

- Open Windows **Computer Management**.
- Go to **Local Users and Groups** and select **Groups**.
- Add the SQL Server service account to the **Hybrid agent extension applications** group.

### Update the registry

> **Warning:**  
> Incorrectly editing the registry can severely damage your system. Before making changes to the registry, we recommend you back up any valued data on the computer.

In the registry, update the **\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL17.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQLServer\FederatedAuthentication** subkey.

Create the following entries:

| Entry | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ArcServerManagedIdentityClientId` | Empty (no value) |
| `HIMDSApiVersion` | `2020-06-01` |
| `HIMDSEndpoint` | `http://localhost:40342/metadata/identity/oauth2/token` |
| `ArcServerSystemAssignedManagedIdentityTenantId` | `Arc-AAD-Tenant-ID` |
| `ArcServerSystemAssignedManagedIdentityClientId` | `Arc-Machine-Client-Id` |
| `PrimaryAADTenant` | `Arc-AAD-Tenant-ID` |
| `AADChannelMaxBufferedMessageSize` | `200000` |
| `AADGraphEndPoint` | `graph.windows.net` |
| `AADGroupLookupMaxRetryAttempts` | `10` |
| `AADGroupLookupMaxRetryDuration` | `30000` |
| `AADGroupLookupRetryInitialBackoff` | `100` |
| `AADServerAdminSid` | `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` |
| `AuthenticationEndpoint` | `login.microsoftonline.com` |
| `CacheMaxSize` | `300` |
| `ClientCertBlackList` | Empty (no value) |
| `FederationMetadataEndpoint` | `login.windows.net` |
| `GraphAPIEndpoint` | `graph.windows.net` |
| `IssuerURL` | `https://sts.windows.net/` |
| `OnBehalfOfAuthority` | `https://login.windows.net/` |
| `STSURL` | `https://login.windows.net/` |
| `MsGraphEndPoint` | `graph.microsoft.com` |
| `SendX5c` | `false` |
| `ServicePrincipalName` | `https://database.windows.net/` |
| `ServicePrincipalNameForArcadia` | `https://sql.azuresynapse.net` |
| `ServicePrincipalNameForArcadiaDogfood` | `https://sql.azuresynapse-dogfood.net` |
| `ServicePrincipalNameNoSlash` | `https://database.windows.net` |
| `AADBecWSConnectionPoolMaxSize` | `500` |

### Back up and edit the registry

The following sections describe how to back up and edit the registry with Registry Editor.

#### Open the Registry Editor

1. Press **Windows key + R** to open the Run dialog box.
1. Type `regedit` and press **Enter**.
1. If prompted by User Account Control, select **Yes**.

#### Back up the registry key

This step backs up the registry before you make any changes. You can import this file back into the registry later if your changes cause a problem.

1. Select **File** from the menu.
1. Select **Export**.
1. In the Export Registry File dialog box, choose a location to save the backup.
1. Enter a name for the backup file in the **File name** field.
1. Ensure **All** is selected in the Export range.
1. Select **Save**.

#### Add entries

In this step, you add entries to the registry with Registry Editor.

1. Navigate this subkey: **\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL17.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQLServer\FederatedAuthentication**.

1. Right-click on **FederatedAuthentication** and select **String Value**.

   Screenshot of Registry Editor.

1. Repeat for each entry listed at [Update the registry](#update-the-registry)

   This image demonstrates a correctly configured registry:

#### Restore the registry key (if needed)

If you need to restore to previous registry settings, follow these steps.

1. Open the Registry Editor as described previously.
1. Select **File** from the menu.
1. Select **Import**.
1. Navigate to the location of your saved backup file.
1. Select the backup file and select **Open**.

## Grant application permissions to the identity

> **Important:**  
> Only a [Privileged Role Administrator](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#privileged-role-administrator) or higher role can grant these permissions.

To enable Microsoft Entra authentication for SQL Server instances, each system-assigned managed identity requires `User.Read.All`, `GroupMember.Read.All`, and `Application.Read.All` permissions to query Microsoft Graph. For more information about these permissions, see:

- [User.Read.All](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#user-permissions): Allows access to Microsoft Entra user information.
- [GroupMember.Read.All](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#group-permissions): Allows access to Microsoft Entra group information.
- [Application.Read.All](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference#application-resource-permissions): Allows access to Microsoft Entra service principal (application) information.

These permissions are application-level permissions (app roles) and must be assigned directly to each managed identity. They can't be manually assigned to a Microsoft Entra security group and granted to members through group membership. For environments with many machines, an alternative is to assign the [Directory Readers](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#directory-readers) role to a [role-assignable Microsoft Entra security group](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/groups-concept) and add the managed identities as members. Unlike app role permissions, this Microsoft Entra role can be granted at the group level, simplifying management at scale. However, **Directory Readers** grants broad read access across all directory objects, significantly exceeding the three targeted Graph API permissions. The **Directory Readers** role isn't recommended for production environments where least-privilege access is required.

The following PowerShell script grants the required permissions to the managed identity. Make sure this script is run on PowerShell 7.5 or a later version, and has the `Microsoft.Graph` module 2.28 or later installed.

```powershell
# Set your Azure tenant and managed identity name
$tenantID = '<Enter-Your-Azure-Tenant-Id>'
$managedIdentityName = '<Enter-Your-Arc-HostMachine-Name>'

# Connect to Microsoft Graph
try {
    Connect-MgGraph -TenantId $tenantID -ErrorAction Stop
    Write-Output "Connected to Microsoft Graph successfully."
}
catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to connect to Microsoft Graph: $_"
    return
}

# Get Microsoft Graph service principal
$graphAppId = '00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000'
$graphSP = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "appId eq '$graphAppId'"
if (-not $graphSP) {
    Write-Error "Microsoft Graph service principal not found."
    return
}

# Get the managed identity service principal
$managedIdentity = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq '$managedIdentityName'"
if (-not $managedIdentity) {
    Write-Error "Managed identity '$managedIdentityName' not found."
    return
}

# Define roles to assign
$requiredRoles = @(
    "User.Read.All",
    "GroupMember.Read.All",
    "Application.Read.All"
)

# Assign roles using scoped syntax
foreach ($roleValue in $requiredRoles) {
    $appRole = $graphSP.AppRoles | Where-Object {
        $_.Value -eq $roleValue -and $_.AllowedMemberTypes -contains "Application"
    }

    if ($appRole) {
        try {
            New-MgServicePrincipalAppRoleAssignment   -ServicePrincipalId $managedIdentity.Id `
                -PrincipalId $managedIdentity.Id `
                -ResourceId $graphSP.Id `
                -AppRoleId $appRole.Id `
                -ErrorAction Stop

            Write-Output "Successfully assigned role '$roleValue' to '$managedIdentityName'."
        }
        catch {
            Write-Warning "Failed to assign role '$roleValue': $_"
        }
    }
    else {
        Write-Warning "Role '$roleValue' not found in Microsoft Graph AppRoles."
    }
}
```
