When you connect to your  SQL Server 
 instance using the system administrator (`sa`) account for the first time after installation, it's important for you to follow these steps, and then immediately disable the `sa` account as a security best practice.

1. Create a new login, and make it a member of the **sysadmin** server role.

   - Depending on whether you have a container or non-container deployment, enable Windows authentication, and create a new Windows-based login and add it to the **sysadmin** server role.

 authentication, and add it to the **sysadmin** server role.
