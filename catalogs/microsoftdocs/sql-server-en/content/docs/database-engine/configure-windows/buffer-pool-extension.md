# Buffer pool extension


**Applies to:**
 

](../../sql-server/sql-docs-navigation-guide.md#applies-to)
 on Windows


Buffer pool extension integrates SSD storage with the  Database Engine 
 buffer pool to improve database performance without incurring high costs of additional memory.

The buffer pool extension isn't available in every  SQL Server 
 edition. For a list of features supported by the editions in  SQL Server 
, see [Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2025](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2025.md).

## Benefits of the buffer pool extension

Because disk I/O operations can take a relatively long time to finish, they're a performance bottleneck in many workloads.

The typical approach to reducing disk I/O is to add more memory for use as a data cache. While helpful, the drawback of this approach is the high memory cost.

The buffer pool extension feature extends the buffer pool cache with nonvolatile storage such as local SSD drives. With this extension, the buffer pool can accommodate a larger database working set, replacing a significant portion of the slower remote I/O with the faster local SSD I/O. Because of the lower latency and better I/O performance of SSDs, the buffer pool extension can improve performance, particularly with the slower remote I/O systems.

The following list describes the benefits of the buffer pool extension feature.

- Increased I/O throughput
- Reduced I/O latency
- Increased transaction throughput
- Improved read performance with a larger hybrid buffer pool
- A caching architecture that can take advantage of present and future low-cost memory drives

### Buffer pool extension concepts

The following terms are applicable to the buffer pool extension feature.

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Buffer** | In the  Database Engine |
| , a buffer is an 8-KB page in memory, the same size as a data or index page. Thus, the buffer cache is divided into 8-KB pages. A page stays in the buffer cache until the buffer manager needs the buffer area to read more data. Data is written back to disk only if it's modified. These in-memory modified pages are known as dirty pages. A page is clean when it's equivalent to its database image on disk. Data in the buffer cache can be modified multiple times before being written back to disk. |
| **Buffer pool** | Also called *buffer cache*. All databases use the buffer pool as a global resource for their cached data pages. The startup process or [sp_configure](../../relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-configure-transact-sql.md) dynamically reconfigures the  Database Engine |
 | instance to determine the maximum and minimum size of the buffer pool cache. This size determines the maximum number of pages that an instance can cache in the buffer pool.<br /><br />External memory pressure can reduce the size of the buffer pool and limit the memory that the buffer pool extension can cache. |
| **Checkpoint** | A checkpoint creates a known good point from which the  Database Engine |
 | can start applying changes contained in the transaction log during recovery after an unexpected shutdown or crash. A checkpoint writes the dirty pages and transaction log information from memory to disk. For more information, see [Database checkpoints (SQL Server)](../../relational-databases/logs/database-checkpoints-sql-server.md). |

## Buffer pool extension architecture

By using buffer pool extension, you can use SSD storage as an extension to the memory subsystem, rather than a part of the disk subsystem. The buffer pool extension file enables the buffer pool manager to use both DRAM and NAND flash memory to maintain a much larger buffer pool of pages on SSDs.

This architecture creates a multilevel caching hierarchy with level 1 (L1) as the DRAM and level 2 (L2) as the buffer pool extension file on the SSD. Only clean pages are written to the L2 cache, which helps maintain data safety. The buffer manager handles the movement of clean pages between the L1 and L2 caches.

The following illustration provides a high-level architectural overview of the buffer pool relative to other  Database Engine 
 components.

When you enable the buffer pool extension, you specify the size and file path of the buffer pool caching file on the SSD. This file is a contiguous extent of storage on the SSD and is statically configured during startup of the  Database Engine 
 instance. You can only alter the file configuration parameters when the buffer pool extension feature is disabled. When you disable the buffer pool extension, the system removes all related configuration settings from the registry. The system deletes the buffer pool extension file upon  Database Engine 
 shutdown.

## Buffer pool extension configuration

Use [ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION](../../t-sql/statements/alter-server-configuration-transact-sql.md) to configure buffer pool extension.

The system considers the physical memory available to the  Database Engine 
 instance at startup to enforce the minimum and maximum buffer pool extension size.

### Maximum size

The maximum buffer pool extension size depends on the  SQL Server 
 edition and differs for physical and virtual machines.

If you configure a size that exceeds the maximum, the  Database Engine 
 returns error 864 and doesn't enable the buffer pool extension.

- SQL Server Enterprise, Enterprise Developer, and Developer editions support up to 32 times the physical memory.

- SQL Server Standard and Standard Developer editions on *physical machines* support up to 4 times the physical memory.

  - Up to a maximum of 512 GB in  SQL Server 2022 (16.x) 
 and earlier versions.

  - Up to a maximum of 1 TB in  SQL Server 2025 (17.x) 
 and later versions.

- SQL Server Standard and Standard Developer editions on *virtual machines* support up to 16 times the physical memory.

For a list of features supported by the editions in  SQL Server 
, see [Editions and supported features of SQL Server 2025](../../sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-2025.md).

### Minimum size

The buffer pool extension size must be larger than the smallest of the physical memory and [max server memory (MB)](server-memory-server-configuration-options.md) values. If the configured size is smaller than this minimum, the  Database Engine 
 raises error 868. If the configured size is smaller than this minimum on instance startup, error 861 is logged and the buffer pool extension isn't enabled.

### Configuration change behavior

You can increase `max server memory (MB)` to a value that's higher than the buffer pool extension size while the extension is enabled. The  Database Engine 
 logs an informational message (error 5866) and applies the change. However, because the new value violates the minimum size requirement, the buffer pool extension is disabled the next time the instance restarts.

If you enable buffer pool extension with a size that's below `max server memory (MB)`, the operation fails with error 868.

## Buffer pool extension best practices

Consider the following best practices:

- After you enable buffer pool extension for the first time, restart the  Database Engine 
 instance to get the maximum performance benefits.
- Set the buffer pool extension so the ratio between the size of physical memory and the size of the buffer pool extension is 1:16 or less. A lower ratio in the range of 1:4 to 1:8 might be optimal. For information about setting the `max server memory (MB)` option, see [Server memory configuration options](server-memory-server-configuration-options.md).
- Test the buffer pool extension thoroughly before implementing it in a production environment. Once in production, avoid making configuration changes to the file or turning off the feature. These activities might have a negative effect on server performance because the buffer pool is significantly reduced in size when the feature is disabled. When disabled, the memory used to support the feature isn't reclaimed until the instance of SQL Server is restarted. However, if the feature is re-enabled, the memory is reused without restarting the instance.

## Monitor buffer pool extension

You can use the following dynamic management views to display the configuration of the buffer pool extension and return information about the data pages in the extension.

- [sys.dm_os_buffer_pool_extension_configuration](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-objects/sys-dm-os-buffer-pool-extension-configuration-transact-sql.md)
- [sys.dm_os_buffer_descriptors](../../relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-objects/sys-dm-os-buffer-descriptors-transact-sql.md)

Performance counters are available in the `SQL Server`, `Buffer Manager` object to track the data pages in the buffer pool extension file. For more information, see [SQL Server, Buffer Manager object](../../relational-databases/performance-monitor/sql-server-buffer-manager-object.md).

The following extended events are available to monitor buffer pool extension in-depth.

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `buffer_pool_extension_pages_written` | Fires when a page or group of pages are evicted from the buffer pool and written to the buffer pool extension file. |
| `buffer_pool_extension_pages_read` | Fires when a page is read from the buffer pool extension file to the buffer pool. |
| `buffer_pool_extension_pages_evicted` | Fires when a page is evicted from the buffer pool extension file. |
| `buffer_pool_eviction_thresholds_recalculated` | Fires when the eviction thresholds are recalculated. |
