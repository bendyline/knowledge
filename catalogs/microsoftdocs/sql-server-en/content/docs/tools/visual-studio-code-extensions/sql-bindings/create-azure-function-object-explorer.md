## Overview

SQL Bindings for Visual Studio Code lets you develop Azure Functions with Azure SQL bindings. For more information, see [Create Azure Functions with the SQL Bindings extension for Visual Studio Code](create-azure-function.md). To install the extension, see [SQL Bindings extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.sql-bindings-vscode).

## From the Object Explorer

To create an Azure Function from a specific table or view in Object Explorer, right-click on a table or view from a connected server in SQL Server Object Explorer and select **Create Azure Function with SQL Binding**.

**Table Object Explorer command**:

**View Object Explorer command**:

If you haven't yet created the Azure Function project, a Visual Studio Code prompt appears to aid in creating a new Azure Function project.

The extension then asks you to select the folder where you want to create the Azure Function.

If you're creating an Azure Function with SQL binding from a table, the extension prompts you to select the binding type to use, either an `Input` (Retrieves data from a database) or `Output` (Save data to a database) binding.

> **Note:**  
> Azure Function with SQL Binding from a view supports only `Input` bindings.

The extension then prompts you to enter the function name to use for the Azure Function.

If you already have connection strings stored in the local.settings.json, the extension prompts you to select the connection string to use for the Azure Function or create a new connection string.

If you select **Create new local app setting**, the extension prompts you to enter the connection string name and value.

If you're creating the Azure Function with SQL Binding to an existing Azure Function project, the extension prompts you whether you want to include the password for the connection string in the `local.settings.json` file.

Screenshot of a prompt to save the password to the SQL connection string.

If you select **Yes**, the password is saved to the `local.settings.json` file. If you select **No**, the extension warns you that the password isn't saved to the `local.settings.json` file (shown in this example), and you need to manually add the password to this file later.

The extension then prompts you to provide the namespace for the Azure Function.

If you're creating a brand new Azure Function project with SQL binding, the extension prompts whether you want to include the password for the connection string in the `local.settings.json` file.

A progress notification appears to indicate that the Azure Function is complete.

Once the Azure Function is created, the extension generates the code for either an `Input` or `Output` binding. For more information, see [Generated code for Azure functions with SQL bindings](create-azure-function.md#generated-code-for-azure-functions-with-sql-bindings).
