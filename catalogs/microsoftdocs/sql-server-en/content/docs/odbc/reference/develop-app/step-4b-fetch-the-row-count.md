 Shows fetching the row count  
  
 If the statement executed in Step 3 was an **UPDATE**, **DELETE**, or **INSERT** statement, the application retrieves the count of affected rows with **SQLRowCount**. For more information, see [Determining the Number of Affected Rows](determining-the-number-of-affected-rows.md).
