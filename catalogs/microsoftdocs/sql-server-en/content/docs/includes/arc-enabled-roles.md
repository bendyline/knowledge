When you install Azure Extension for SQL Server in non-least-privilege mode, the installation:

1. Creates a server-level role: `SQLArcExtensionServerRole`
1. Creates a database-level role: `SQLArcExtensionUserRole`
1. Adds the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account to each role
1. Maps `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` at the database level for each database
1. Grants minimum permissions for the enabled features

Alternatively, you can configure 
 SQL Server 
 enabled by Azure Arc to run in least privilege mode. For more information, see [Operate SQL Server enabled by Azure Arc with least privilege](../sql-server/azure-arc/configure-least-privilege.md).

In addition, Azure Extension for SQL Server revokes permissions for these roles when they're no longer needed for specific features.

> **Note:**  
> The previously described actions require the Deployer to connect to SQL Server as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. If the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` login is removed, disabled, or denied `CONNECT SQL` permission, the Deployer can't perform any of these actions, and the Azure Extension for SQL Server fails to provision. See [Prerequisites](../sql-server/azure-arc/prerequisites.md) for steps to verify and restore this login.

`SqlServerExtensionPermissionProvider` is a Windows task. It executes Deployer.exe to grant or revoke privileges in SQL Server when it detects:

- A new SQL Server instance is installed on the host
- A SQL Server instance is uninstalled from the host
- An instance-level feature is enabled or disabled, or settings are updated
- The extension service is restarted
- [Just-in-time (JIT) permissions](../sql-server/azure-arc/configure-windows-accounts-agent.md#just-in-time-sql-permissions) are enabled or disabled

> **Note:**  
> Before the July 2024 release, `SqlServerExtensionPermissionProvider` was a scheduled task that ran hourly.

For details, review [Configure Windows service accounts and permissions for Azure Extension for SQL Server](../sql-server/azure-arc/configure-windows-accounts-agent.md).

If you uninstall Azure Extension for SQL Server, the server-level and database-level roles are removed.
