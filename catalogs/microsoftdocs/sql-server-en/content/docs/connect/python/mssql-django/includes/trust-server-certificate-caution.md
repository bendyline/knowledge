> **Caution:**
> Use `TrustServerCertificate=yes` only for local development with self-signed certificates. Don't use it in production. It disables certificate chain validation and increases adversary-in-the-middle risk. Install a trusted certificate on the server and connect with `TrustServerCertificate=no`.
