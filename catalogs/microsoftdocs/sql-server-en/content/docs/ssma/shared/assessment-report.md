# Assessment Report

The Assessment Report window in SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) shows the results of the conversion of database objects to  Transact-SQL  syntax, and can also help you estimate the complexity and cost of your migration projects.

To access the Assessment Report, select objects to convert in the source metadata explorer, right-click **Schemas**, and then select **Create Report**.

## Options

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Conversion statistics** | Shows the conversion statistics by statement type. This pane is visible when a group object, such as a schema, or an object without code is selected in the left pane. |
| **Objects by Categories** | Shows the number of objects by category. This pane is visible only when a group object, such as a schema, or an object without code is selected in the left pane. |
| **Statistics** | Shows the conversion statistics for the selected object. This pane is visible only when an individual object with code is selected in the left pane. You might have to expand **Statistics**, which is immediately above the **Source** pane, to view this pane. |
| **Source** | Shows the source code for the selected object, and highlights code that wasn't converted to  Transact-SQL . This pane is visible only when an individual object with code is selected in the left pane.<br /><br />Select the line numbers to set or clear bookmarks. To navigate through the code, use the buttons at the top of the pane. |
| **Target** | Shows the conversion's resulting  Transact-SQL  code for the selected object, and error messages for code that wasn't converted. This pane is visible only when an individual object with code is selected in the left pane.<br /><br />Select the line numbers to set or clear bookmarks. To navigate through the code, use the buttons at the top of the pane. |
| **Messages pane** | Shows the errors, warnings, and informational messages that were generated while creating the assessment report. Messages are grouped by number. To view the code that caused the error, select **Errors**, **Warnings**, or **Info**, expand the category of messages, and then select a message. |
