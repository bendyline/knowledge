# Project Settings (Synchronization)

The Synchronization page of the **Project Settings** dialog box in SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) contains settings that customize how SSMA loads and refreshes database objects, such as tables and stored procedures, into  SQL Server 
.

The default actions options specify default settings for refreshing objects from the source database and for synchronizing objects with the SQL Server database.

You can access two different Synchronization pages that contain the same settings:

- To specify settings for all future SSMA projects, navigate to **Tools** > **Default Project Settings**, and then select **Synchronization** at the bottom of the left pane.

- To specify settings for the current project, navigate to **Tools** > **Project Settings**, and then select **Synchronization** at the bottom of the left pane.

## Miscellaneous options

#### Attempts

Specifies the number of attempts SSMA should make when it loads objects into  SQL Server 
. Objects that aren't loaded into  SQL Server 
 in the current attempt are tried again, until SSMA reaches the maximum number of attempts in the current synchronization process. Default value is `2`.

## Synchronization for source database options

#### Action on local and remote object change

Specifies the default setting in the **Synchronization** dialog box when the object definition changes in SSMA and on the database server. Default value is **Refresh from database**.

- If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA loads database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.

- If you select **Skip**, SSMA doesn't perform any refresh actions.

#### Action on local object change

Specifies the default setting in the **Synchronization** dialog box when the object changes in SSMA. Default value is **Skip**.

- If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA loads database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.

- If you select **Skip**, SSMA doesn't perform any refresh actions.

#### Action on remote object change

Specifies the default setting in the **Synchronization** dialog box when the objects change on the database server. Default value is **Refresh from database**.

- If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA loads database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.

- If you select **Skip**, SSMA doesn't perform any refresh actions.

#### Action when local object metadata is missing

Specifies the default setting in the **Synchronization** dialog box when local metadata is missing. Default value is **Refresh from database**.

- If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA loads database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.

- If you select **Skip**, SSMA doesn't perform any refresh actions.

## Synchronization for SQL Server options

#### Action on local and remote object change

Specifies the default setting in the **Synchronization** dialog box when the object definition changes in SSMA and on the database server. Default value is **Write to database**.

- If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA loads database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.

- If you select **Write to Database**, SSMA updates objects in the database according to SSMA metadata contents when the condition is met.

- If you select **Skip**, SSMA doesn't perform any refresh actions.

#### Action on local object change

Specifies the default setting in the **Synchronization** dialog box when the object changes in SSMA. Default value is **Write to database**.

- If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA loads database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.

- If you select **Write to Database**, SSMA updates the object in the database according to SSMA metadata contents when the condition is met.

- If you select **Skip**, SSMA doesn't perform any refresh actions.

#### Action on remote object change

Specifies the default setting in the **Synchronization** dialog box when the objects change on the database server. Default value is **Refresh from database**.

- If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA loads database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.

- If you select **Write to Database**, SSMA updates the object in the database according to SSMA metadata contents when the condition is met.

- If you select **Skip**, SSMA doesn't perform any refresh actions.

#### Action when local object metadata is missing

Specifies the default setting in the **Synchronization** dialog box when local metadata is missing. Default value is **Refresh from database**.

- If you select **Refresh from Database**, SSMA loads database definitions into the metadata when the condition is met.

- If you select **Write to Database**, SSMA updates the object in the database according to SSMA metadata contents when the condition is met.

- If you select **Skip**, SSMA doesn't perform any refresh actions.
