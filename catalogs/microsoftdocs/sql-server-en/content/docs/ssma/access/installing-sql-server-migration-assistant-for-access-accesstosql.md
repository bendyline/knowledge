# Install SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access (AccessToSQL)

The SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) client migrates Access databases. Supported target versions include  SQL Server 2019 (15.x) 
 and later versions on Windows and Linux,  Azure SQL Database 
, and Azure SQL Managed Instance.
 The client:

- Connects to the Access source and the  SQL Server Database Engine 
 target.
- Converts database objects for the target.
- Loads the converted objects into the target.
- Migrates the data.
