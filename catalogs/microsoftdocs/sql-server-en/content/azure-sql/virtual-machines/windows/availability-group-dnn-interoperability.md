# Feature interoperability with AG and DNN listener



  **Applies to:**    [SQL Server on Azure VM](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/sql-server/sql-docs-navigation-guide#applies-to)

> **Tip:**
> There are many [methods to deploy an availability group](availability-group-overview.md#deployment-options). Simplify your deployment and eliminate the need for an Azure Load Balancer or distributed network name (DNN) for your Always On availability group by creating your SQL Server virtual machines (VMs) in [multiple subnets](availability-group-manually-configure-prerequisites-tutorial-multi-subnet.md) within the same Azure virtual network. If you've already created your availability group in a single subnet, you can [migrate it to a multi-subnet environment](availability-group-manually-migrate-multi-subnet.md). 

Certain SQL Server features rely on a hard-coded virtual network name (VNN). When you use the distributed network name (DNN) listener with your Always On availability group and SQL Server on Azure VMs in a single subnet, you might encounter some limitations.

This article describes SQL Server features and interoperability with the availability group DNN listener.

## Behavior differences

Note the following differences between the functionality of the VNN listener and DNN listener:

- **Failover time**: Failover time is faster when you use a DNN listener since there's no need to wait for the network load balancer to detect the failure event and change its routing.
- **Existing connections**: Connections to a *specific database* within a failing-over availability group close, but other connections to the primary replica remain open, since the DNN stays online during the failover process. This behavior is different from a traditional VNN environment where all connections to the primary replica typically close when the availability group fails over, the listener goes offline, and the primary replica transitions to the secondary role. When you use a DNN listener, you might need to adjust application connection strings to ensure that connections are redirected to the new primary replica upon failover.
- **Open transactions**: Open transactions against a database in a failing-over availability group close and roll back, and you need to *manually* reconnect. For example, in SQL Server Management Studio, close the query window and open a new one.

## Client drivers

For ODBC, OLEDB, ADO.NET, JDBC, PHP, and Node.js drivers, specify the DNN listener name and port as the server name in the connection string. To ensure rapid connectivity upon failover, add `MultiSubnetFailover=True` to the connection string if the SQL client supports it.

## Tools

Users of [SQL Server Management Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms), [sqlcmd](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/tools/sqlcmd-utility), and [SQL Server Data Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/ssdt/sql-server-data-tools) need to specify the DNN listener name and port as the server name in the connection string to connect to the listener.

Creating the DNN listener by using the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) GUI isn't currently supported.

## Availability groups and FCI

You can configure an Always On availability group by using a failover cluster instance (FCI) as one of the replicas. For this configuration to work with the DNN listener, the [failover cluster instance must also use the DNN](failover-cluster-instance-distributed-network-name-dnn-configure.md) as there's no way to put the FCI virtual IP address in the AG DNN IP list.

In this configuration, the mirroring endpoint URL for the FCI replica needs to use the FCI DNN. Likewise, if the FCI is used as a read-only replica, the read-only routing to the FCI replica needs to use the FCI DNN.

The format for the mirroring endpoint is: `ENDPOINT_URL = 'TCP://<FCI DNN DNS name>:<mirroring endpoint port>'`.

For example, if your FCI DNN DNS name is `dnnlsnr`, and `5022` is the port of the FCI's mirroring endpoint, the Transact-SQL (T-SQL) code snippet to create the endpoint URL looks like:

```sql
ENDPOINT_URL = 'TCP://dnnlsnr:5022'
```

Likewise, the format for the read-only routing URL is: `TCP://<FCI DNN DNS name>:<SQL Server instance port>`.

For example, if your DNN DNS name is `dnnlsnr`, and `1444` is the port used by the read-only target SQL Server FCI, the T-SQL code snippet to create the read-only routing URL looks like:

```sql
READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL = 'TCP://dnnlsnr:1444'
```

You can omit the port in the URL if it's the default 1433 port. For a named instance, configure a static port for the named instance and specify it in the read-only routing URL.

## Distributed availability group

If you configure your availability group listener by using a distributed network name (DNN), you can't configure a distributed availability group on top of your availability group.

## Replication

Transactional, Merge, and Snapshot Replication all support replacing the VNN listener with the DNN listener and port in replication objects that connect to the listener.

For more information on how to use replication with availability groups, see [Publisher and AG](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/configure-replication-for-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server), [Subscriber and AG](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/replication-subscribers-and-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server), and [Distributor and AG](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/replication/configure-distribution-availability-group).

## MSDTC

Both local and clustered MSDTC are supported, but MSDTC uses a dynamic port. This dynamic port requires a standard Azure Load Balancer to configure the HA port. As such, the VM must use a standard IP reservation, or you can't expose it to the internet.

Define two rules: one for the RPC Endpoint Mapper port 135, and one for the real MSDTC port. After failover, modify the load balancer rule to the new MSDTC port after it changes on the new node.

If the MSDTC is local, be sure to allow outbound communication.

## Distributed query

Distributed query relies on a linked server, which you can configure with the AG DNN listener and port. If the port isn't 1433, choose the **Use other data source** option in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) when configuring your linked server.

## FILESTREAM

FILESTREAM is supported but not for scenarios where users access the scoped file share by using the Windows File API.

## FileTable

FileTable is supported but not for scenarios where users access the scoped file share by using the Windows File API.

## Linked servers

Configure the linked server with the AG DNN listener name and port. If the port isn't 1433, choose the **Use other data source** option in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) when configuring your linked server.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Which SQL Server version supports AG DNN listener?

SQL Server 2019 CU 8 and later versions.

#### What is the expected failover time when I use the DNN listener?

For DNN listener, the failover time is the same as the AG failover time, without any extra time (like probe time when you're using Azure Load Balancer).

#### Is there any version requirement for SQL clients to support DNN with OLEDB and ODBC?

Use the `MultiSubnetFailover=True` connection string for DNN listener support. It's available starting with SQL Server 2012 (11.x).

#### Are any SQL Server configuration changes required for me to use the DNN listener?

SQL Server doesn't require any configuration change to use DNN, but some SQL Server features might require more consideration.

#### Does DNN support multiple-subnet clusters?

Yes. The cluster binds the DNN in DNS with the physical IP addresses of all replicas in the availability group regardless of the subnet. The SQL client tries all IP addresses of the DNS name regardless of the subnet.

#### Does the availability group DNN listener support read-only routing?

Yes. Read-only routing is supported with the DNN listener.
